The only way I have ever gotten the nvidia drivers to not hang (using swsusp, tuxonice, uswsusp, whatever) is to use suspend-to-ram after disabling whatever magic video card hackery the distro tries (on the theory that the nvidia binary driver knows more about the quirks my card has than the sleep scripts the distro uses). > Michael > > > _______________________________________________ > TuxOnIce-users mailing list > enpsfhxz-stvnz@lists.tuxonice.net > http://lists.tuxonice.net/mailman/listinfo/tuxonice-users > ------------------------------ >From nlnpr@nigel.suspend2.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 08:10:19 +1100 From: Nigel Cunningham  Subject: Re: [TuxOnIce-users] [TuxOnIce-devel] 3.0-rc5 released.

Alternatively, you can just set the  default console level higher than 1, or change it while hibernation is  running. This assumes that you have PM_DEBUG enabled.

Once you know that it  may be possible to decode the pattern to discover what is being found in  your logwatch mail. It may also be possible to instruct your system to  not scan mail from logwatch. dp ------------------------------ >From buddgrbonu@gmail.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:38 2008 Message: 5 Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2008 16:20:40 +0200 From: T?r?k Edwin  Subject: Re: [Clamav-users] Clamdscan not find viruses To: ClamAV users ML  Message-ID: <47AB13B8.1020406@gmail.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Rick Macdougall wrote: > Hi, > > I have another example where clamdscan fails to find a virus but  > clamscan does. > > > I have a copy of the message in question if one of the devs would like a  > copy. > >    Please open a bugreport, and attach the sample (marked as private).

PhishingScanURLs was no (hard coded), changing it to yes  makes clamdscan see it. How ever the reason I saw it was because a message came in on mail  server 3 last night and was not caught, but the message was then  forwarded to a user on mail server 2 where it was rejected by clamdscan. Now, mail server 2 did not see the virus this morning when I checked it  again but it obviously did last night when PhishingScanURLs = no. Any reason for that that you can see ?

Once \nyour old messages have all been learned, you need to feed to it only new \narrivals, that is since the last sa-learn run. No need to keep 180 days worth \nof ham and spam in the temp folder!\n\n\nLet sa-learn complete and then chop the folder. Just concatenate the process \nrather than schedule it in crontab.

The design is for a multi-user system, and even assuming\nthat all users are both legitimate AND use the system in good\nfaith, it assumes that not all programmers are perfect, and\nthat accidents DO in fact happen.\n\nThat's what all of the read/write/execute permissions are\nabout.\n\nAnd THAT is what keeps me and my system safe.\n\n> \n> The notion that malware on linux was technically not feasible is \n> highly irrational. I think experienced senior linux users shouldn't \n> keep on spreading this deceptive mantra. You should know better.\n\nThe primary threat is the buffer-overflow problem, which was\ndemonstrated so devastatingly in 1987 by the Morris Worm. We\nlearned our lessen then about the use of strcat() instead of\nstrncat(), and other similarly unlimited writes into stack\nspace (or other memory for that matter).\n\n> \n> Malware is not entirely about root, remember?

On any desktop.\n\nYou truly don't know what you're talking about.\n\nGo buy AND READ \"The Design of the Unix Operating System\"\nby Maurice J. Bach.\n\nI paid $80 or so for the 3rd edition in the 1980's.\nUsed copies of the 4th edition are now available for\nthe paltry sum of $15 or so.\n\n> \n> Be good, Wolfgang\n\n\n\n    -------\n\n    additional_emails: []\n\n    URLs Identified in Body: No URLs identified\n    </input_email>\n  ",

You might look at Options->MailFilters as a work around. We host mailboxes for the clients who have websites with us and we've combined SPAMASSIN and a home grown prefilter which does something similar to the mailfilter function, but in front of spamassin. Has cut down my spam to about 1/6 original volume and mailfilter will move the offensive ones that get by out as well.  One thing, don't delete the spam because you will have false positives (i.e., ham that gets marked as spam). Setting up spamassin is an ISP IPP function.  so you need to talk to them.  Use the mailfilter until this happens and as a backup afterwards.

It may well be that we  didn't get the wording right yet. First, a confession: most of the major changes in -02 are my doing.  In particular, I think I pushed some things onto Jim that went  further than he had wanted.  I think it's unfair to ask Jim to defend  things that are basically my own responsibility.  I particularly  apologize because I went in for major surgery just about the time  this was hitting the fan, and I'm not yet fully functioning. There's a certain philosophical difference between folks on this  list.  Some want SSP to be extremely specific.  Others have gone on  at length that the SSP spec has no right or authority to impose its  own will on receivers.  I have sympathies for both positions, but I  have to agree that there is no chance that we can successfully  dictate how receivers operate.  I've said publicly many times that  receivers will simply ignore the specs if it makes their lives better  --- as we see today with intentional violations of RFC 2822.  SSP-02  is an attempt to pare SSP down to appeal to the second set.  Yes,  that weakens SSP, but that seems inevitable at this point.  In  particular, I'm concerned that without giving receivers any guidance  on how certain situations should be handled we'll end up in a fairly  chaotic state.  However, I do agree that such guidance should  probably go in a non-standards-track document. A few specific points from your message: --On February 6, 2008 1:46:58 AM -0500 Hector Santos   wrote: [...] > With SSP-02/ASP, we lost the powerful SSP-01 DKIM=ALL protection > against 3rd party fraud. Speaking about SSP-02, I'm not sure how you see we've lost that  \"protection\".  In -01, DKIM=ALL specifically allowed 3PS (Third-Party  Signatures), so arguably it was weaker before.  Under SSP-02, a  receiver could decide that 3PS should be treated more harshly (where  \"more harshly\" doesn't necessarily mean \"discard\" --- it could just  mean do content scanning on the message). We did remove all discussion of 3PS.  The extended list discussion  around them made it clear that we just don't have enough operational  knowledge at this time to understand how they should work.  As such,  we are now leaving all interpretation of 3rd party signatures up to  the receiver.  That doesn't mean we've necessarily lost the ability  to handle 3PS in a distinct way, but it will have to go into another  document, at least for now. > The NEVER concept can still be covered using DKIM=DISCARDABLE and a > NULL DKIM public key. > > The EXCLUSIVE concept can still be covered using DKIM=DISCARDABLE. Except that DISCARDABLE doesn't prohibit 3PS.  It doesn't even say  that messages without any signatures MUST or even SHOULD be  discarded.  All it says is how the purported author domain views the  messages that it sends out.  The furthest it goes is to say that the  purported Author Domain \"encourages the recipient(s) to discard it.\" > But anything related to 3rd party signers was completely eliminated > in SSP-02/ASP.  Even though SSP-02 DKIM=ALL is a \"always sign for > 1st party authors\" concept, it is basically a DKIM=DISCARDABLE > without semantics on REJECTION.  DKIM=DISCARDABLE failures is > explicit with the REJECTION control.  DKIM=ALL failures are not. SSP-02 DKIM=ALL is not a \"always sign for 1st party authors\" concept.  It doesn't even mention first parties, any more than it mentions 3rd  parties.  All it says is \"when the message left my control, I had  signed it.\"  It says absolutely nothing about how the receiver should  handle the message. Similarly, and as noted above, DKIM=DISCARDABLE makes no normative  assertions about what the receiver should do with the message.  It is  impossible to say anything about when the receiver should reject  messages without stepping into the forbidden territory of forcing a  certain behavior on the receiver. > In short, DKIM=ALL is the SPF version of SOFTFAIL where you can > record it, but you do not take any REJECTION action on it.  Just > like SPF. There's nothing that prevents the recipient from rejecting messages  under a DKIM=ALL condition.  In fact (if we did it as intended) there  is no normative language anywhere in SSP-02 about how the receiver  should process messages, be they signed, unsigned, or 3PS. [...] > But that is not the case with DKIM.

I'm not speaking to ASP, but SSP-02 makes (or is intended to make) NO  normative restrictions on when the receiver should accept or reject  any messages. Another addition to SSP-02 was the concept of the Evaluator.  This  was added purely to try to make it clear that SSP is merely one input  into the decision process.  The Evaluator decides whether to reject a  message, quarantine it, do additional content scanning on it, accept  it without further scanning, redirect it to the FBI, post it on  USENET, or anything else it cares to do.  My hope was that creating  an explicit entity that makes the decision and clearly declare it out  of scope we would clarify the limits of SSP. It is my sincere hope that we will quickly gain enough experience  that new documents can be produced providing further guidance (not  requirements) for how the Evaluator should interpret SSP for broadest  interoperability. eric ------------------------------ >From mwbfbfl@santronics.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 2 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 06:28:05 -0500 From: Hector Santos  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section \t2.8 To: Eric Allman  Cc: DKIM List  Message-ID: <47AC3CC5.3000407@santronics.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed Eric, I sincerely appreciate your response and I do hope you are on your way  to full recovery from your surgery. I had a hip replacement a few years  back and it was the first time in a long time I was forced into a  prolonged 'vacation' from work. :-) It been a long road to where we are now.  A road where we tuned nearly  every stone and discussed, and even worked out.  There were some  remaining issues, but ones that I don't believe were not addressable. The best I can describe the concerns is that we lost the potential for  protocol consistency fraud. For example, you pointed out SSP-01 DKIM=ALL offered 3rd party  signatures and this could be deemed weaker,  I agree with that point. However, I never indicated that a VALID 3rd party was ever classified as  secured, but the lack of one is were the power of the concept is found. The concept is really nothing new compare to other fraud detection  concepts, things we all do in some form or another, include SMTP. A simple example is a traffic cop requesting and analyzing your driver  license.  The officer is first going to make sure that the attributes  indicated on the card matches what he sees in person. If the driver is a  20 year old woman and the license says 60 year old man, then this among  other thing he can compare raises a red flag. Anything that doesn't conform to expectations is always the first thing  people notice.  As you know, this is a basic model in lots of things we do. In our SMTP world, an excellent example is PORT 25 and its relaxed SMTP  compliance versus PORT 587 and its strict SMTP compliance requirements.    i.e, EHLO checking under port 25 is recognized as low benefit for many  historical reasons.  Under port 587, EHLO correctness is a requirement.    Same with other expects between the two protocols.   In short, PORT  587 has less tolerance towards legacy operations - by design.  You must  login.  You must have certain headers, etc. Even in standard SMTP port 25 operations, we have basic x822 header  requirements that some systems may be very strict about if they don't  exist in the DATA block or post SMTP processing. But there is no BCP for  this. But with DKIM/SSP we can take control of this now and not allow it to  become yet another \"relaxed\" protocol. So again, the power here is in protocol inconsistency fraud detection.  Once things are all \"compliant\" then the other things comes into play,  because there is really not much more DKIM/SSP can do from this point. This is where other layers may come into play, including reputation  ideas and anything else.  I never argued against reputation. I just felt  that one group was trying to based DKIM/SSP on it only and not even  given the SSP concept a chance.  Unfortunately, the entire process has  been commandeered in what appears to be a strategic goal to simply water  it down to a level of total uselessness. So to me the idea of an Evaluator would be first a fundamental protocol  consistency Evaluator that would be part of the DKIM/SSP framework  across all supportive/compliant systems.  It would be 100% independent  from any subjective or heuristics or reputation analysis or any one  group detecting their questionable inherent policies or implementations  methods. It really has nothing to do with good guys vs bad guys because as we  know, bad guys too can exhibit compliant behavior.  But that is we want  here - we want to make sure everyone (bad and good) are all playing in  the same field of following the basic fundamental protocol.  Just like  we expect with other any standard client/server communications protocol. We want this model because if we can't expect compliance with the GOOD,  than we can't expect it from the BAD, and if we allow DKIM/SSP to become  this, we would be back to square one of relaxed SMTP legacy transactions  where receivers lack enforcement and know hows but more importantly has  no new information to rely on beyond the normal level of operations to  consider. DKIM/SSP changes all that, this is what lead me to technology and I of  the belief this will be a major benefit for the SMTP industry. But this is only going to work with a standard protocol \"out of the box\"  all must follow if they wish to implement it.  I think this is all  separate from having extra evaluators (i.e, reputations, spam-assassin,  etc).   If we start with standard relaxed higher level system, then we  will have lost an unique opportunity we haven't had in SMTP.

The furthest it goes is to say that the   > purported Author Domain \"encourages the recipient(s) to discard it.\" Eric, Agreed.  This changes \"strict\" (the exclusivity) assertion into   something that does not express a domain's intentions on exclusivity.    This assertion simply increases the likelihood of having the domain's   messages discarded. You have previously mentioned the motivation was to accommodate high   profile domains finding themselves victims of phishing attacks.  Using   the term \"discardable\" appears to be sending the wrong message.  It   seems unlikely these high profile domains want their messages silently   discarded, as this assertion implies.  Discarding of messages does   several things: - Destroys evidence of a serious crime - Reduces delivery integrity for important transactional messages - Makes resolving compatibility far more problematic Can you see changing this into terminology that does not attempt to   suggest a verifier action?  Going out on limb, I'll add a modified   furthermore statement.  (Frankly, this furthermore statement seems to   belong in a BCP that happens later.) Using Hector's term \"exclusive\"- exclusive: All mail from the domain is signed with an intent to avoid agents that may damage or remove signatures.  Furthermore, in lieu of a trusted third-party signature, if a message arrives without a valid Author Signature due to modification in transit, submission via a path without access to a signing key, or other reason, the domain encourages the recipient(s) to reject the message or issue a DSN when the RFC 2821 MAILFROM domains match. -Doug ------------------------------ >From dupzyp@returnpath.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 4 Date: Fri, 8 Feb 2008 13:01:14 -0500 From: \"J D Falk\"  Subject: RE: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section \t2.8 To: \"DKIM List\"  Message-ID: \t<8k3p2k4495405372skl3204q9f4g5d728klpg0@rpnyex01.rpcorp.local> Content-Type: text/plain;\tcharset=\"us-ascii\" Eric wrote: > It is my sincere hope that we will quickly gain enough experience that > new documents can be produced providing further guidance (not > requirements) for how the Evaluator should interpret SSP for broadest > interoperability. +1 ------------------------------ >From jbtl+fzfg@sendmail.org  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 11:15:15 -0800 From: Eric Allman  Subject: Re: [ietf-dkim] draft-ietf-dkim-ssp-02.txt ASP/SSP section \t2.8 To: Hector Santos  Cc: DKIM List  Message-ID: <52069CA5ADAE4FDE65B4E124@rieux.neophilic.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed Hector, I have to admit that I'm having a bit of problem understanding  everything you are saying in your response, perhaps because I haven't  been able to get through the nearly 500 messages that came in while I  was recuperating.  I finally concluded that I had to just jump in,  but I am missing some context. Thanks for your example on SMTP vs SUBMIT --- that gives me a good  handle on what you mean by \"relaxed protocol\".  But I'm not  understanding \"protocol consistency fraud\".  I think they are  connected, but I don't understand how, and how SSP-02 makes it easier  vs. SSP-01. So far as I am aware, the SSP-02 /protocol/ is no weaker than in  SSP-01.  What is weaker normative requirements on how the receiver  interprets that protocol, which is inevitable if you buy into the  idea that SSP has no right to impose any requirements on the  receivers.  If you're disagreeing with that premise then I fully  understand; this is just a case where you have to choose one and go  with it, because you can't have it both ways.  As I said before, my  position is that as desirable as it may seem to put requirements on  the receiver in order to guarantee consistent results, the reality is  that the receivers will do whatever they want to in order to give the  best results for themselves and their customers.  Hence, saying \"no  normative requirements for receivers\" is in my mind just bowing to an  inevitable reality. This is at the root of eliminating the concept of 3rd Party  Signatures.  They were only relevant in terms of how the receiver  interprets the DKIM results, and hence inappropriate for discussion. You say some things about the Evaluator that lead me to believe that  you've got a different idea of what it should be than I do.  You say: > So to me the idea of an Evaluator would be first a fundamental > protocol consistency Evaluator that would be part of the DKIM/SSP > framework across all supportive/compliant systems.  It would be > 100% independent from any subjective or heuristics or reputation > analysis or any one group detecting their questionable inherent > policies or implementations methods. This is the inverse of the model in my head, where the Evaluator is  completely /dependent/ on \"subjective or heuristics or reputation  analysis\" --- it is, in short, how the receiver decides how to  process the message.  Indeed, the point of introducing the concept is  an attempt to make explicit what is out of scope for normative  definition in the SSP spec. If I'm misunderstanding what you are trying to say (very possible)  then I apologize and request further explanation. eric --On February 8, 2008 6:28:05 AM -0500 Hector Santos   wrote: > Eric, > > I sincerely appreciate your response and I do hope you are on your > way to full recovery from your surgery.

It's an assertion that the sender would prefer that the recipient not   deliver some small fraction of legitimate email as well as some small   fraction of illegitimate email, rather than delivering those small   fractions of legitimate and illegitimate email. In the senders opinion, it is more important that mail claiming to be   from them not be delivered than for it to be delivered. The english meaning of \"discardable\" matches the semantics pretty   well. If we want implementors to easily understand and deploy the   specification, and more importantly the limits of them doing so, thats   fairly important.
