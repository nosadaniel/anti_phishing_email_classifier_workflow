If i look at the vector code it is public final void removeElementAt(int index) {    System.arraycopy(m_Objects, index + 1, m_Objects, index,                     *m_Size - index - 1*);    m_Size--;  } Like in java Vector shouldn't this be *index ?

As input I take data from a relational database. Below is a sample from this table stored in a MySQL database. Each row represents an \"EVENT\": ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1    t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3    t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_10  t3 : j    USER_1   EVENT_1     t_i j+1  USER_2   EVENT_4   t_i+1 : N    USER_A   EVENT_3   t_z ID: unique for each row. USER_X: USER with X an element from the set [0 .. A) identifying a user. EVENT_Y: EVENT with Y an element from the set [0 .. B) identifying an event. Conneting to the database works fine. Now, I would like to obtain the following format: A \"User-based B-dimensional vector/dictionary\" of all events where each position in this vector space corresponds to an event and holds a binary value - 0 or 1 - indicating whether the event occured or not. So duplicates are neglected. For the sample table below with B =3D 7 (indicating that there a 7 different events, numbered 0 through 6), this might look like: ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1   t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3   t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_4   t3 4    USER_1   EVENT_6   t4 5    USER_2   EVENT_5   t5 USER_1: (0,1,0,1,1,0,1) USER_2: (0,0,0,0,0,1,0) I hope that someone can help me out.

There are lots of great books available, which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools, artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods, some of which are implemented in Weka. Here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights: 1. To start with, Whitten & Frank's book on Data Mining is a great one. This is the book Weka refers to. There are also ones by Han; D. Hand on the same topic and widely used. 2. For Artificial Intelligence, Russel and Norvig; or Winston; or Knight or Charniak are widely read authors. In addition to all the books, there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides, papers, articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy. MIT has a great open source tutorial, most good Universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read. Hope this should help, Regards, Subrat ________________________________ From: mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz [mailto:mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz] On Behalf Of Andhra Loyola College Sent: Thursday, February 07, 2008 12:13 PM To: iuxxdkqk@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz Subject: [Wekalist] where can i find algorithms explanation dear weka forum,                         I had gone through all the documentations present in source forge, but i could not find clear explanation of the algorithms.Can some one tell me where i can find them in Internet. thank u. sunanda ________________________________ Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

This site is simply like no other. \nIACmusic.com is an indie all-star site, it recently got mention in\nRolling Stone, and has been called the online world's most innovative\nmusic portal.  We reach out to bring in artists who are truly creative\nwith influences vast.  Cashbox found the quality of music on the site so\noutstanding that now all content on their Indie Charts comes directly\nfrom IAC.   Our traffic is huge and growing, word of mouth is off the\nhook, and our station set-up is years beyond any other music site. \nMeanwhile, our community is thriving with station managers who actively\npounce on the new releases and will help promote your songs for you.\nAlso, IAC stations will soon be available to listen to via any cellphone\nwith our recent move into that arena. \nWe are about the music and indie culture.   No cookie-cutters were used\nin the making of this site.  IAC is colorful and magical, to reflect the\ncreativity of the artists themselves.  If you choose, you can sell your\ndownloads, set your own price and you get 100% of the take.  You can\nbuild digital CDs called DMDs which include the revolutionary IAC\nUltrapage.  IAC's dedicated support department is always there to answer\nyour questions.  Check out the site here.  If you want to find real\nlisteners, this is the place to do it. \nHere's a direct shortcut to start a free page.  Any additional exposure\nwill help you get your music to the world. \nHope to hear your songs at IAC soon! \nToby, a&r - IACmusic.com \n_______________________________________________\nTo unsubscribe or change your e-mail preferences for the Dixieland Jazz Mailing list, or to find the online archives, please visit:\n\nhttp://ml.islandnet.com/mailman/listinfo/dixielandjazz\n\n\n\nDixielandjazz mailing list\nDixielandjazz@ml.islandnet.com\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://APlaceForJazz.org']\n    additional_emails: ['jerrygordon@juno.com', 'Dixielandjazz@ml.islandnet.com', 'music@ridethekiac.com']\n\n    sender_name: Jerry Gordon\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 14:31:22 -0400\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": true, "trust_score": 0, "explanation": "The sender address and subject line contain generic greetings and urgency tactics, which are common in phishing emails.

Many of these people \nare forgoing doctors\u2019 visits or relying on emergency rooms for their medical \ncare, the study said.  \nThe report, based on an analysis of government health surveys of adults ages \n18 to 64 years old, estimated that about 11 million of the 36 million people \nwithout insurance in 2004 \u2014 the latest year of the study \u2014 had received a \nchronic-condition diagnosis.  \n\u201cThese are people who, with modern therapies, can be kept out of trouble,\u201d \nsaid Dr. Andrew P. Wilper, the study\u2019s lead author. Therapies for someone with \ndiabetes and hypertension \u201care routine and widely available, if you have \ninsurance,\u201d said Dr. Wilper, a medical instructor at the _University of Washington_ \n(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/universit\ny_of_washington/index.html?inline=nyt-org)  in Seattle. \nThe most recent government estimate of the number of people in this country \nwithout _health insurance_ \n(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=ny\nt-classifier)  is 47 million, which means that if the proportions found in \nthe study have remained constant, there might be nearly 16 million people in \nthis country with a chronic condition but no insurance to pay for medical care. \nNearly a quarter of the uninsured with a chronic illness who were surveyed \nsaid they had not visited a health professional within the last year. About 7 \npercent said they typically went to a hospital emergency room for care. \n\u201cA lot of people are suffering from a lack of health insurance,\u201d said Dr. \nSteffie Woolhandler, another of the study\u2019s authors, who is a physician and \nassociate professor of medicine at Harvard.  \nPeople with high blood pressure, for example, are at risk for catastrophic \nmedical events like a stroke if they are not getting the drugs they need or \nhaving a doctor monitor their disease, said Karen Davis, the president of the \nCommonwealth Fund. The fund, a foundation in New York that specializes in health \ncare research, has done its own research into the lack of adequate medical care \namong the uninsured.  \nThe study, being published Tuesday, may have underestimated exactly how many \npeople who are uninsured have a chronic illness, because it includes only \nthose who have already received such a diagnosis, the authors said. Individuals \nwho have not had their conditions diagnosed because they are not seeing a doctor \nor nurse are not included. \nThe study\u2019s authors say that their findings cast doubt on the common \nassumption that many of the uninsured tend to be young and healthy, requiring little \nin the way of medical care. Because so many actually have chronic conditions \nthat may be expensive to treat, the cost of covering the uninsured is often \nunderestimated, said Dr. Woolhandler, who advocates a nationalized system of \nhealth care.  \nIn Massachusetts, she said, the state\u2019s effort to overhaul its health \ninsurance system to cover more residents is costing much more than expected and has \nnot led to universal coverage because policy makers assumed that more people \nwould be healthy. \u201cThe state experiments have all failed because of cost,\u201d she \nsaid.  \nThe study describes harsh consequences for neglecting easily treatable \ndiseases in so many people. \u201cFor some of the 11.4 million uninsured Americans with \nserious chronic conditions, access to care seems to be unobtainable; many may \nface early disability and death as a result,\u201d the study\u2019s authors said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************Looking for a car that's sporty, fun and fits in your budget? \nRead reviews on AOL Autos.      \n(http://autos.aol.com/cars-BMW-128-2008/expert-review?ncid=aolaut00050000000017 )\n\n---\nYou are currently subscribed to lwv-healthcare as: 1b10055440efac18fc80423f8be268d5@mail.reutter.co.uk.\nTo unsubscribe send a blank email to leave-799581-2905919.f98f1b2721e7d78ac4be9537845ff3f7@lists.lwv.org\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://www.nytimes.com/)']\n    additional_emails: ['leave-799581-2905919.f98f1b2721e7d78ac4be9537845ff3f7@lists.lwv.org', '1b10055440efac18fc80423f8be268d5@mail.reutter.co.uk']\n\n    sender_name: Poliric\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 20:09:45 -0400\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": true, "trust_score": 0, "explanation": "The email contains several red flags, including a suspicious sender address, generic subject line, unrelated content, and multiple links to NY Times articles.", "recommendation": "Do not click on any links or visit the website mentioned in the email.", "urls": ["http://www.nytimes.com/"], "url_check_results": [{"is_malicious": false, "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "confidence": 0.5, "details": "Not blacklisted"}]}, "llm_model": "llama3.1:8b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": true, "is_correct": false}}
