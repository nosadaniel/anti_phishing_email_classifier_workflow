The only way I have ever gotten the nvidia drivers to not hang (using swsusp, tuxonice, uswsusp, whatever) is to use suspend-to-ram after disabling whatever magic video card hackery the distro tries (on the theory that the nvidia binary driver knows more about the quirks my card has than the sleep scripts the distro uses). > Michael > > > _______________________________________________ > TuxOnIce-users mailing list > enpsfhxz-stvnz@lists.tuxonice.net > http://lists.tuxonice.net/mailman/listinfo/tuxonice-users > ------------------------------ >From nlnpr@nigel.suspend2.net  Sun Feb 24 10:27:37 2008 Message: 5 Date: Fri, 08 Feb 2008 08:10:19 +1100 From: Nigel Cunningham  Subject: Re: [TuxOnIce-users] [TuxOnIce-devel] 3.0-rc5 released.

Alternatively, you can just set the  default console level higher than 1, or change it while hibernation is  running. This assumes that you have PM_DEBUG enabled.

As input I take data from a relational database. Below is a sample from this table stored in a MySQL database. Each row represents an \"EVENT\": ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1    t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3    t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_10  t3 : j    USER_1   EVENT_1     t_i j+1  USER_2   EVENT_4   t_i+1 : N    USER_A   EVENT_3   t_z ID: unique for each row. USER_X: USER with X an element from the set [0 .. A) identifying a user. EVENT_Y: EVENT with Y an element from the set [0 .. B) identifying an event. Conneting to the database works fine. Now, I would like to obtain the following format: A \"User-based B-dimensional vector/dictionary\" of all events where each position in this vector space corresponds to an event and holds a binary value - 0 or 1 - indicating whether the event occured or not. So duplicates are neglected. For the sample table below with B =3D 7 (indicating that there a 7 different events, numbered 0 through 6), this might look like: ID | USER_X | EVENT_Y | TIME ---------------------------- 1    USER_1   EVENT_1   t1 2    USER_1   EVENT_3   t2 3    USER_1   EVENT_4   t3 4    USER_1   EVENT_6   t4 5    USER_2   EVENT_5   t5 USER_1: (0,1,0,1,1,0,1) USER_2: (0,0,0,0,0,1,0) I hope that someone can help me out.

There are lots of great books available, which will present a clear and consice picture of the data mining tools, artificial intelligence methodologies or the machine learning methods, some of which are implemented in Weka. Here find listed some of the books you could use for gaining deeper insights: 1. To start with, Whitten & Frank's book on Data Mining is a great one. This is the book Weka refers to. There are also ones by Han; D. Hand on the same topic and widely used. 2. For Artificial Intelligence, Russel and Norvig; or Winston; or Knight or Charniak are widely read authors. In addition to all the books, there are a host of materials available on the internet inthe form of tutorials slides, papers, articles and even open source training material that can be very useful and also handy. MIT has a great open source tutorial, most good Universities have some teaching material posted by professors which you can read. Hope this should help, Regards, Subrat ________________________________ From: mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz [mailto:mackmusd-hbijzgs@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz] On Behalf Of Andhra Loyola College Sent: Thursday, February 07, 2008 12:13 PM To: iuxxdkqk@list.scms.waikato.ac.nz Subject: [Wekalist] where can i find algorithms explanation dear weka forum,                         I had gone through all the documentations present in source forge, but i could not find clear explanation of the algorithms.Can some one tell me where i can find them in Internet. thank u. sunanda ________________________________ Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!

This coercion doesn't happen if the\nreturn value of t0::mynum() goes directly into int() without going via\nthe overloading system.\n\n[Please do not change anything below this line]\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n---\nFlags:\n    category=core\n    severity=low\n---\nSite configuration information for perl v5.8.8:\n\nConfigured by zefram at Fri Jan 19 20:29:50 GMT 2007.\n\nSummary of my perl5 (revision 5 version 8 subversion 8) configuration:\n  Platform:\n    osname=linux, osvers=2.6.8-3-686-smp, archname=i386-linux-thread-multi-64int\n    uname='linux monst.rous.org 2.6.8-3-686-smp #1 smp thu sep 7 04:39:15 utc 2006 i686 gnulinux '\n    config_args='-des -Darchname=i386-linux -Dcccdlflags=-fPIC -Dccdlflags=-rdynamic -Dprefix=/home/zefram/usr/perl/perl_install/perl-5.8.8-i64-f52 -Dman1ext=1 -Dman3ext=3perl -Duselargefiles -Dusethreads -Uafs -Ud_csh -Uusesfio -Uusenm -Duseshrplib -Duse64bitint'\n    hint=recommended, useposix=true, d_sigaction=define\n    usethreads=define use5005threads=undef useithreads=define usemultiplicity=define\n    useperlio=define d_sfio=undef uselargefiles=define usesocks=undef\n    use64bitint=define use64bitall=undef uselongdouble=undef\n    usemymalloc=n, bincompat5005=undef\n  Compiler:\n    cc='cc', ccflags ='-D_REENTRANT -D_GNU_SOURCE -DTHREADS_HAVE_PIDS -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -I/usr/local/include -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64',\n    optimize='-O2',\n    cppflags='-D_REENTRANT -D_GNU_SOURCE -DTHREADS_HAVE_PIDS -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -I/usr/local/include'\n    ccversion='', gccversion='3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-13)', gccosandvers=''\n    intsize=4, longsize=4, ptrsize=4, doublesize=8, byteorder=12345678\n    d_longlong=define, longlongsize=8, d_longdbl=define, longdblsize=12\n    ivtype='long long', ivsize=8, nvtype='double', nvsize=8, Off_t='off_t', lseeksize=8\n    alignbytes=4, prototype=define\n  Linker and Libraries:\n    ld='cc', ldflags =' -L/usr/local/lib'\n    libpth=/usr/local/lib /lib /usr/lib\n    libs=-lnsl -ldl -lm -lcrypt -lutil -lpthread -lc\n    perllibs=-lnsl -ldl -lm -lcrypt -lutil -lpthread -lc\n    libc=/lib/libc-2.3.2.so, so=so, useshrplib=true, libperl=libperl.so\n    gnulibc_version='2.3.2'\n  Dynamic Linking:\n    dlsrc=dl_dlopen.xs, dlext=so, d_dlsymun=undef, ccdlflags='-rdynamic -Wl,-rpath,/home/zefram/usr/perl/perl_install/perl-5.8.8-i64-f52/lib/5.8.8/i386-linux-thread-multi-64int/CORE'\n    cccdlflags='-fPIC', lddlflags='-shared -L/usr/local/lib'\n\nLocally applied patches:\n    \n\n---\n@INC for perl v5.8.8:\n    /home/zefram/usr/perl/perl_install/perl-5.8.8-i64-f52/lib/5.8.8/i386-linux-thread-multi-64int\n    /home/zefram/usr/perl/perl_install/perl-5.8.8-i64-f52/lib/5.8.8\n    /home/zefram/usr/perl/perl_install/perl-5.8.8-i64-f52/lib/site_perl/5.8.8/i386-linux-thread-multi-64int\n    /home/zefram/usr/perl/perl_install/perl-5.8.8-i64-f52/lib/site_perl/5.8.8\n    /home/zefram/usr/perl/perl_install/perl-5.8.8-i64-f52/lib/site_perl\n    .\n\n---\nEnvironment for perl v5.8.8:\n    HOME=/home/zefram\n    LANG (unset)\n    LANGUAGE (unset)\n    LD_LIBRARY_PATH (unset)\n    LOGDIR (unset)\n    PATH=/home/zefram/pub/i686-pc-linux-gnu/bin:/home/zefram/pub/common/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/games\n    PERL_BADLANG (unset)\n    SHELL=/usr/bin/zsh\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: No URLs identified\n    additional_emails: ['hzyoze@fysh.org']\n\n    sender_name: Zefram\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 07:27:57 -0700\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 100, "explanation": "Legitimate Perl mailing list email with clear bug report and no suspicious content.", "recommendation": "Reply to the sender or forward the email to the relevant team for further discussion.", "urls": [], "url_check_results": []}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

These variables are all read-only\n               and dynamically scoped to the current BLOCK.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the documentation does not more carefully define\nwhat it means by \"nested block\" here: from the point of view of the read\naccess of $1 in the examples, the inner match is not occurring in a nested\nblock. From the point of view of the program as a whole, the second case\ncertainly contains a nested block; the first case might or might not,\ndepending what \"nested\" means; the first case also either might or might\nnot have \"exited\" its block (nested or no), depending on precisely what\n\"exited\" means - my own interpretation is that it hasn't exited the block\nyet, but that's a sentiment based more on my limited understanding of the\nimplementation than on any documentation.\n\nIf we can work out what the documentation is supposed to be saying, and\nwhat all the words mean, maybe we have a better chance of deciding whether\nthe implementation matches that, and if not, fixing it.\n\nHugo\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: No URLs identified\n    additional_emails: []\n\n    sender_name: w\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 15:17:05 +0100\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 100, "explanation": "Legitimate Perl mailing list discussion with no suspicious content or URLs.", "recommendation": "Accept the email as legitimate and respond accordingly.", "urls": [], "url_check_results": []}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

Although the USDA euphemistically calls their enforcement actions \"renewal pending subsequent audit,\" it is clear that there are numerous violations of organic standards taking place in the U.S. and across the world. A number of the violations noted in the several hundred page audit related to Chinese imports certified by the French-based organic certifier Ecocert and other certifiers.\n\nStrangely enough, Quality Assurance International (QAI), the largest organic certifier in the world, is not cited by the USDA, even though the OCA has recently reviewed documents that indicate that QAI is indeed under investigation by the NOP. QAI has recently been in the news for sourcing ginger, contaminated with a dangerous and banned pesticide, Aldicarb, from its Chinese certification sub-contractors and then labeling it as \"USDA Organic.\" QAI is also under public fire, along with other certifiers, for certifying factory farm feedlot dairies supplying milk to Horizon and Aurora Organic Dairy, who in turn supply Wal-Mart, Costco, Safeway, and other organic private label organic milk.\n\nLearn more and take action: http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_13943.cfm\n\n________________________________\n\nALERT OF THE WEEK: \nSENATOR SAYS STOP BRAINWASHING CHILDREN TO EAT JUNK FOOD\nA new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report has revealed that food and beverage corporations spent $1.6 billion dollars in food advertising in 2006. As parents and public health officials understand, the nation's alarming surge in childhood obesity and diabetes are directly related to increased consumption of junk food. Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) has urged industry and government regulators to redirect the massive funds spent every year in junk food advertising toward education and programs focused on healthy eating.

The Earth can no longer carry the burden of groundwater mining, pesticide pollution, disappearance of species and destabilization of the climate. Farmers can no longer carry the burden of debt, which is inevitable in industrial farming with its high costs of production. It is incapable of producing safe, culturally appropriate, tasty, quality food. And it is incapable of producing enough food for all because it is wasteful of land, water and energy. Industrial agriculture uses ten times more energy than it produces. It is thus ten times less efficient.\"\n\nDr. Vandana Shiva, scientist, world-renowned author, and grassroots leader in India.

That amounts to over six times the amount of fish the entire U.S. population eats annually. Wild fish fed to animals on a massive scale include perfectly edible anchovies, sardines, mackerel, and herring, which are ground into a cheap fishmeal and sold for animal feed. In other words a protein source is being fed to animals on corporate farms with a 90% energy loss. Given the global food crisis and the over-harvesting of many of the ocean's commercial fish varieties, careful analysis of resource use by the global industrial food complex is becoming a life or death imperative.

New trends in urban farming, like vertical gardening and backyard chickens, can help feed households in an economical and earth friendly way. New technologies in micro-generation, powering your home with a wind turbine or solar paneling, for example, are making off-the-grid living more financially feasible than ever. In fact, priorities in Silicon Valley are already shifting from developing better microchips towards focusing on thin-film solar cells. Meanwhile, programs like 'Solar City' are offering 20% savings in solar paneling installations for neighborhoods who buy in bulk.

Three-quarters of the restaurants in South L.A. are fast food, and the City Council hopes the decision will attract healthier alternatives. The decision was made after area residents complained that junk food was destroying public health. The resolution is likely to be used as a model by other cities where similar citizen campaigns are launched.

Now\nthat I'm getting back into it, I'll keep up with things again. So, let\nme know if any of the skipped threads should be brought in.\nCorrections and comments welcome as always.\n\n=============\nAnnouncements\n=============\n\n=========\nSummaries\n=========\n\n---------------\nAbout SSL tests\n---------------\n\nAn open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep\nopen. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a\n'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the\nterminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform\nSubprocess Termination`).\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `About SSL tests\n`__\n\n-------------------------------------\nCross-Platform Subprocess Termination\n-------------------------------------\n\nBecause os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows\nplatforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows\nplatforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.\nSupport was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-\nplatform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually\nincorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was\ngiven.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)\n\n------------------------\nExtended buffer protocol\n------------------------\n\nUpdates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP\ndocumenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the\nplans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.\n\n(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real\ndegree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants\nto add to the summary, it will stay short.)\n\nContributing threads:\n\n- `Extended buffer PEP\n`__\n- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)\n`__\n- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples\n`__\n\n-----------------------------------------\nfunction for counting items in a sequence\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),\nimplemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping\nbetween items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were\nsuggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of\nitems not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning\ndue to a just-makes-sense factor.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `function for counting items in a sequence\n`__\n\n----------------------------------------\ncontext manager - generator interaction?\n----------------------------------------\n\nA problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside\nthe with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context\nmanager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist\nwithout the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of\na formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `context manager - generator interaction?\n`__\n\n-----------------------------\nproposed which.py replacement\n-----------------------------\n\nSuggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to\nits proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have\nyet to be provided.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `proposed which.py replacement\n`_\n\n-----------------------\nminidom and DOM level 2\n-----------------------\n\nWhat is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and\nsome work jumpstarted.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `minidom and DOM level 2\n`__\n\n----------------------------------------------\ntest_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?\n----------------------------------------------\n\nDiffering buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose\nmode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes\nbefore a waitpid() call.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?\n`__\n\n\n\n================\nDeferred Threads\n================\n\n==================\nPrevious Summaries\n==================\n\n===============\nSkipped Threads\n===============\n\n- `Checking PEP autobuild results\n`__\n- `Python 2.5.1c1 pickle problem\n`__\n- `build problem on windows: unable to find getbuildinfo2.c\n`__\n- `BaseException pickle issue\n`__\n- `Summary of Tracker Issues\n`__\n- `possible urllib bug on Windows XP\n`__\n- `Py2.5.1 release candidate\n`__\n- `Some new additions to functools\n`__\n- `Python+XUL `__\n- `Distutils and -framework on MacOSX\n`__\n- `HTTP responses and errors\n`__\n- `[Python-checkins] svn dead?\n`__\n- `Just saying hello\n`__\n- `ok to just checkin minor obvious fixes?\n`__\n- `__lltrace__ `__\n- `new subscriber looking for grunt work\n`__\n- `functools additions\n`__\n- `Python Documentation Problem Example\n`__\n- `Get 2.5 changes in now, branch will be frozen soon\n`__\n- `Quoting netiquette reminder [Re: proposed which.py replacement]\n`__\n- `branch is frozen for release of 2.5.1c1 (and 2.5.1)\n`__\n- `More exposure for PEP8 (was: context manager - generator\ninteraction?) `__\n- `[Python-checkins] Python Regression Test Failures opt (1)\n`__\n- `Weekly Python Patch/Bug Summary\n`__\n- `deprecating BaseException.message\n`__\n- `USE_FAST code in stringobject.c\n`__\n- `Fwd: Re: Py2.5.1 release candidate\n`__\n- `Fwd: Re: Changes to decimal.py\n`__\n- `svn.python.org\n`__\n- `[PATCH] pep 0324 URL update\n`__\n- `Pydoc Rewrite Discussion at doc-sig list.\n`__\n- `my 2.5 checkins\n`__\n- `Making builtins more efficient\n`__\n- `fdopen mode needs sanitizing\n`__\n- `Py3: function signatures, type checking, and related crap\n`__\n- `concerns regarding callable() method\n`__\n- `A Survey on Defect Management Practices in Free/Open Source\nSoftware `__\n- `RELEASED Python 2.5.1, release candidate 1\n`__\n- `Python 3000 PEP: Postfix type declarations\n`__\n- `test_socketserver flakey?\n`__\n- `Changes to decimal.py\n`__\n\n\n-- \nRead my blog!

I am testing various parameter settings to see which one yields the best results. I am experimenting with various learning rates, momentums and delay on/off. So far most of the parameter combinations yielded good results of around 85% correctly classified instances. But every once in a while I find a combination of parameters where the classification doesnt work at all and one (sometimes even two) class(es) seems to be left out of the process and the confusion matrix looks like the following:     a    b    c   <-- classified as     0 6838    4 |    a = '(-inf-0.25]'     0 6728   72 |    b = '(0.25-0.75]'     0 2141 4952 |    c = '(0.75-inf)' I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this.

Syntax otherwise the same as the sa-learn-spam filter.\n\nThe sa-learn --spam can process a message in 5 to 10 seconds or so, so if I've \ndropped 20 doofus mails in the spam directory and fire it off, I have it done \nand kmail is back among the living in 2-3 minutes.\n\nBut, feeding it a 'ham' directory with about 7k messages in it, turned \nsa-learn into a 100% cpu hog, incrementing the message processed number only \nabout every 3 to 5 minutes. I couldn't kill it, it kept coming back and I \nmust have fed it a kill -9 50 times.  Finally, one of the kills killed x too!  \nBut no console came back, so I had to hit the reset button.  The reboot was \nlike molassses in January, so I did a power down, same story.  Same story 3 \ntimes running, so I went and made a sandwich while it set powered down.  Then \nthe reboot was normal up to e2fscking a a 372GB drive I use for amanda, the \nbackup proggy.  That hung, with no indication of progress for about 20 \nminutes, no marching **** or anything.  But it finally fell through and \ncompleted the bootup, and is running normally now but it has taken the \nmajority of an hour to do this.\n\nSo what is the maximum number of files in a directory that one can feed to \nsa-learn --ham and expect it to achieve normal speed?  I vaguely recall \nfeeding it my corpus of another folder it was having trouble with a year ago, \nthe linux-usb list, 600 to 1k messages in it and it was finished in an hour \nthat time.\n\nThe command that kmail issues to it is:\nsa-learn --ham  /root/Mail/(foldername)/cur\n\nWhere foldername is whatever mailing list I want to tell it is ham.\n\nIs this correct?  I've had it setup that way for 2 or 3 years at least and \ntill now it hasn't been that much of a problem.\n\n-- \nCheers, Gene\n\"There are four boxes to be used in defense of liberty:\n soap, ballot, jury, and ammo.

As each island grows, the \nhuge weight of cooled magma, a pile extending many kilometers above the \nocean floor, bends the ocean crust downward. Two related large \n(Mw = 6.0 and 6.7) earthquakes struck the island of \nHawaii on 15 October 2006 and have helped reveal important aspects of this \nprocess. Both earthquakes occurred in the mantle. One was particularly \ndeep, 39 km below the surface, and implied local extension; the other was \nshallower, at a depth of about 19 km, and suggested lateral compression. \nThrough finite-element modeling, McGovern shows that the different \nmechanisms reflect modification of the broad bending process by the \ndifferent strengths of the lower crust and mantle, producing compression at\ndepths shallower than about 32 km and extension below, with strain focused \nnear the depth of the deeper quake. In addition, compression at a depth of \n19 km would tend to restrict the ascent of magmas, consistent with the \nnotion that the crust is being underplated by cooled magmas at this depth. \n-- BH\nGeophys.

Plant viruses, \ntraveling messenger RNAs, gene-silencing RNAs, these and more are the \nvarious guises of RNA in plants. For infectious RNAs, structural \nmotifs--sequences that form hairpins and loops and bulges--are necessary \nboth for RNA replication and for RNA trafficking between cells. Using a \ngenome-wide mutational analysis of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), \nwhich replicates in the host cell's nucleus, Zhong et al. have \ninvestigated what these two processes share in terms of structural motifs. \nPotatoes produced by plants infected by this viroid are smaller and lumpier\nthan usual, and the viroids move through the leaf cells, into the phloem, \nand then on to distant parts. The PSTVd RNA adopts a rod-shaped structure, \nand all of the loops were essential for fully successful replication and \ntrafficking. Loops toward one end of the rod and in the middle were \ncritical for replication; damage to loop 11 produced viroids able to travel\nwell but not so apt to replicate; finally, one loop in its native state \nactually seemed to repress replication. Comparisons with other types of \nviroid RNAs hint at a conservation of structure-function relationships for \nsome loops. -- PJH\nPlant Cell 20, 10.1105/tpc.107.056606 (2008).\n\n\n\n\nAPPLIED PHYSICS: Light amid Disorder\n\nDavid Voss\n\n\n\nIn semiconductors, the concept of an energy gap that separates conducting \nelectrons from localized valence states is fundamental to understanding the\nmaterials' optical and electronic properties. Researchers discovered in the\n1980s that photons can behave in a similar way: Optical materials \nfabricated with just the right periodic structures exhibit energy (or \nfrequency) regions where light passes through and other energy zones where \ntransmission of light is blocked. Just as semiconductor band gaps lead to a\nwide range of useful technological properties, photonic band gaps can do \nthe same for optical materials. Researchers have assumed that in order to \nproduce the photonic band gaps, high-quality crystalline materials are \nrequired. Edagawa et al. present computational results showing \nthat amorphous diamond without lattice periodicity can also exhibit strong \nphotonic band gaps. The results challenge the traditional view that \nphotonic band gaps are strictly a consequence of Bragg reflection and \ninterference in which electromagnetic waves are scattered from various \nplanes formed by a periodic atomic lattice. Thus, a range of photonic band \ngap systems could potentially be synthesized from materials such as \npolymers, proteins, and colloids that lend themselves naturally to \namorphous structures. -- DV\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 100, 13901 (2008).\n\n\n\n\nPHYSICS: Profiles in Charge\n\nIan S. Osborne\n\n\n\nThe availability of high-power lasers emitting intense pulses over \nfemtosecond and picosecond time scales enables the study of high-field \nprocesses such as photo-dissociation and photo-excition of atoms and \nmolecules in the laboratory. Such processes are relevant across a range of \ndisciplines, from the study of photoinduced chemical reactions in the \natmosphere to the more fundamental probing of the electronic excitations in\natoms. When an intense laser pulse hits a cloud of atoms or molecules, the \nintensity profile of the laser pulse will produce a specific distribution \nof ions. After exciting a cloud of Xe atoms with intense laser pulses, \nStrohaber and Uiterwaal implement a time-of-flight technique that samples \nthe pulse focal region with micrometer resolution, allowing the \ndistribution of ions to be mapped out in three dimensions. On the flip \nside, the profile of the ion distributions can be used as an intensity \nsensor to aid the characterization and optimization of intense laser \npulses. -- ISO\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 100, 23002 (2008).\n\n\n\n\nGENOMICS: A High-Salt Lifestyle\n\nBarbara R. Jasny\n\n\n\nBonneau et al. describe progress in an effort to link \nsystems-level analysis to events at the molecular and organismal levels. \nUsing experiments and computation, they have pooled transcriptome, \nprotein-protein interaction, structural, and evolution-related data to \ngenerate a dynamic model of the halophilic organism Halobacterium \nsalinarum. This model was trained on data sets that included more than\n200 microarray experiments measuring responses to genetic perturbations and\nenvironmental factors (oxygen, sunlight, transition metals, ultraviolet \nradiation, and desiccation and rehydration). The model, known as EGRIN \n(environment and gene regulatory influence network) represents \ntranscriptional regulation for 1929 of the 2400 genes in H. \nsalinarum, and it was used to predict transcriptional changes after \nenvironmental or genetic perturbations (or combinations thereof) that had \nbeen held out of the training data sets. As an example, the gene \nnhaC3 encodes a Na+ extrusion pump that allows this \norganism to grow under high-salt conditions. Analyses of a map of \nprotein-DNA interactions generated from ChIP-chip data could not dissect \nwhich of five possible transcriptional regulators governed expression of \nthe gene, yet one of these was predicted by EGRIN to have the strongest \neffect, which was confirmed in laboratory experiments. -- \nBJ\nCell 131, 1354 (2007).\n\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT: The Debt of Nations\n\nCaroline Ash\n\n\n\nTracking the worldwide depletion of ecosystem resources is a complex \ninternational problem. Srinivasan et al. have used a simplified \naccounting framework to link populations who experience ecological damage \nto those who cause it. The largest and most blatant imbalance is the debt \nwe (high-income countries) owe to low-income countries because of climate \nchange. On a per capita basis, people in high-income countries are \nresponsible for almost six times more greenhouse gas emissions than their \nlow-income counterparts. Included in the tally is, for instance, the luxury\ndebt accrued by high-income consumers of farmed shrimp; this demand \nencourages the destruction of coastal mangrove trees to clear the way for \nshrimp ponds. The resulting loss of storm protection is increasing the risk\nto adjacent cities as sea levels rise and coral reefs collapse (see also \nGrimm et al., Review, p. 756). \nSimilarly, middle-and high-income countries consume most of the world's \nfish; nevertheless, several food-deficient African countries charge only \nmodest access fees for the mining of their rich offshore fisheries. Despite\nthe difficulties of measurement and the need to simplify, this analysis \nraises provocative questions about the division of responsibilities for \nenvironmental harm. -- CA\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 10.1073/pnas.0709562104 \n(2008).\n\n\n\n\nSCIENCE SIGNALING: Hearing Essentials About Glutamate Transporters\n\nElizabeth M. Adler\n\n\n\nAlthough three vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) have been \nidentified, only two are found in identified glutamatergic neurons. In \ncontrast, VGLUT3 is expressed in several populations of neurons that \nrelease other classical neurotransmitters, including inhibitory GABAergic \ninterneurons in the hippocampus and cortex. Seal et al. found that\nmice lacking VGLUT3 were profoundly deaf: They failed to show a startle \nresponse to loud noises and did not exhibit auditory evoked potentials. \nElectrophysiological analysis revealed a defect in signaling from the inner\nhair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea to the auditory nerve, and morphological \nanalysis showed abnormalities of IHC synapses. Immunofluorescence revealed \nthat VGLUT3 was present in synaptic regions of the IHCs of wild-type mice. \nWhereas the conductances in the IHCs of the mice lacking VGLUT3 resembled \nthose in wild-type mice, electrophysiological analysis indicated that these\nneurons failed to release glutamate. The authors conclude that VGLUT3 is \nessential for hearing and plays an important role in the regulation of \ncortical excitability. -- EMA\nNeuron 57, 263 (2008).\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsubscribe or edit your subscriptions for this service at:\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/alerts/main\n\nWritten requests to unsubscribe may be sent to:\nCustomer Service, 1454 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304, U.S.A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMagazine  |  News  |  Signaling\n|  Careers  |  Multimedia  |  Collections  |  Help  \n|  Site Map | RSS\nSubscribe  |  Feedback  |  Privacy / Legal  |  About Us  | Advertise With Us  |  Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2008 American Association for the Advancement of \nScience.\u00a0All Rights Reserved.AAAS is a partner of HINARI,\nAGORA, PatientInform, CrossRef, \nand COUNTER.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- - - - - miRNAs and Cancer Webinar brought to you by \nScience - - - - - \nJoin us February 20, 2008, at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time (9am \nPST, 5pm GMT)\nfor a new webinar discussing miRNAs and Cancer.

I thought it was  something about permissions, and the shellscript part just confirmed  that. Alls the perl vars, including $mailbox contain the right value. I've tried different owners for the .pl file and all kind of  permissions, including suid, and perl always says 0 and shell always  says permission denied.

(' UID 1967)',) I decided last week to try to debug this a little bit myself.  I know almost nothing about the workings of IMAP, but the problem appears to be that sb_imapfilter isn't accounting for responses like this one:   [     (       '6 (BODY[] {3130}'     , 'Return-Path: <MAILER-DAEMON...about 3000 characters snipped...'     )    , ' UID 6)'   ] In particular, that last fragment is where sb_imapfilter gets upset. I don't know whether the real bug is in whatever gets passed to sb_imapfilter to be used as its \"server\" attribute, or whether it's here, but if you look carefully at the response data structure above, which is passed back from the server object to sb_imapfilter, you'll see that the parenthesization that was in the original text coming back from the real IMAP server (i.e. a computer) is \"violated\" by the data structure, which leads me to believe that the problem might be in whatever is parsing that response into the data structure (the server object, I presume)... although I'm not sure what it is actually supposed to be doing in this case, so it's hard to say The following patch (which, given my scant knowledge, is almost certainly wrong) makes the problem disappear for me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- You can respond by visiting:  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=498105&aid=1707814&group_id=61702\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=498105&aid=1707814&group_id=61702']\n    additional_emails: []\n\n    sender_name: \"SourceForge.net\"\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 16:39:23 -0700\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 95, "explanation": "Legitimate email from SourceForge.net with a patch for spambayes-Patches-1707814.", "recommendation": "Accept the attachment and apply the patch.", "urls": ["https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=498105&aid=1707814&group_id=61702"], "url_check_results": [{"is_malicious": false, "url": "https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=498105&aid=1707814&group_id=61702", "confidence": 0.5, "details": null}]}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

Moon \net al. (p. 782) \ndescribe a non-interferometric approach to phase-determination based on the\nisospectrality, which describes pairs of simple polygonal shapes that have \nthe same frequency response--that is, if these shapes were drumheads, they \ncould sound the same and be indistinguishable. The authors used scanning \ntunneling microscopy to position CO molecules on the Cu(111) surface at \ncryogenic temperatures to bound isospectral shapes. Despite the imperfect \nnature of this boundary, the spectral fingerprints of the two-dimensional \nelectronic states in the terahertz range were the same within experimental \nerror. The authors then used this property to extract the wave function \nphase. Phase extraction should be possible in two-dimensional quantum \nsystems provided that the boundary shapes can be constructed.\nCREDIT: HARI MANOHARAN/STANFORD \nUNIVERSITY\n\n\n\n\nSpin Hall Effect of Light\n\n\n\n\nHall effects manifest as the transverse movements of carriers of electronic\ncurrent in the presence of an external field, and recent work has \nconcentrated on the spin Hall effect, in which the effects depend on the \nspin of the electron and not just its charge. Hosten and Kwiat (p. \n787,\npublished online 10 January; see the Perspective by Resch) \nnow report on the observation of an optical version of the spin Hall effect\nthat developed a sensitive metrological technique capable of detecting \ndisplacements on the angstrom scale. When light refracts at an air-glass \ninterface, there is an additional displacement of the light that depends on\npolarization. In this optical system, the polarization of the light \ninteracts with a refractive index gradient in a manner analogous to how \nelectronic spins are affected by electric fields.\n\n\n\n\nMoving with the Heat\n\n\n\n\nMost materials have a positive coefficient of thermal expansion--they \nexpand when heated--but there are exceptions, such as cubic zirconium \ntungstate, which will contract over a wide temperature range. Silver(I) \nhexacyanocobaltate( III) is a framework material that has highly \nunderconstrained Co-CN-Ag-NC-Co linkages. Goodwin et al. \n(p. 794) \nfind that over a wide temperature range, this material can either contract \nor expand along orthogonal lattice directions with a coefficient an order \nof magnitude greater than that of most materials. They attribute these \nlarge movements to the framework flexing like a hinged lattice, of the sort\ncommonly seen in garden fencing.\nCREDIT: GOODWIN ET \nAL.\n\n\n\n\nEvery Step You Take\n\n\n\n\nAs we walk, we expend energy not only in pushing off with our planted leg \nbut also when our other leg decelerates as it makes contact with the \nground. Donelan et al. (p. 807) \nhave developed a mechanical device to harvest some of the expended energy \nin this deceleration step in much the same fashion as hybrid automobiles \nutilize regenerative braking. The device is light, fastens at the knee, and\nproduces about 5 watts of power, potentially enough power to charge \nportable medical devices.\n\n\n\n\nBonds, Shaken and Sliced\n\n\n\n\nSoon after the development of narrow-frequency laser sources, chemists \nattempted to use these sources to excite specific chemical bonds. \nUnfortunately, the deposited energy usually spread around the rest of the \nmolecular framework too rapidly for the chosen bond to break. More \nrecently, studies have shown that if collisions with other molecules or \ncatalytic surfaces occur soon enough after vibrational excitation, reaction\nefficiencies can be selectively enhanced. Killelea et al. \n(p. 790; \nsee the Perspective by Mullins and\nSitz) now take this approach a step further to show that by exciting \nthe C-H stretch in the CHD3 isotopomer of methane just prior to \ncollision with a nickel surface, they can achieve a 30:1 ratio of C-H to \nC-D bond cleavage, relative to a 1:3 ratio in a thermally equilibrated \nsample. Quantification of this selective scission required a technically \ndemanding mass-resolved detection scheme of thermally desorbed products.\n\n\n\n\nSounding Out Earth's Core\n\n\n\n\nEarth's solid inner core is predominantly a phase of iron at high \npressures. One important clue for determining the properties of the core is\nthat sound waves passing through Earth's solid inner core propagate fastest\nalong the north-south direction, which suggests that there is a preferred \nalignment of iron crystals. Belonoshko et al. (p. 797) \npresent numerical calculations which show that the body-centered cubic form\nof iron is strongly anisotropic to seismic waves and can match the observed\n12% anisotropy, whereas the hexagonal close-packed form, previously thought\nto make up the inner core, is not.\n\n\n\n\nMixed-Up Microflora\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship between an animal host and the complex mixture of microbes\nit carries in its gut is a delicate one, and the exact role the host immune\nsystem plays in maintaining commensal homeostasis remains unclear. Ryu \net al. (p. 777, \nsee the Perspective by Silverman \nand Paquette; published online 24 January) examined the expression of \nantimicrobial proteins in the gut of the fruit fly, Drosophila \nmelanogaster. Although the key immune transcriptional regulator \nnuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) was chronically activated in the flies by \nindigenous gut microflora, only a subset of NF-B-regulated antimicrobial genes was actually expressed\nbecause of transcriptional repression exerted by the intestinal homeobox \ngene Caudal. Disruption of Caudal expression resulted in the \nexpression of a different subset of antimicrobial peptides, as well as a \ndramatic change in the composition of the intestinal microflora that led to\nthe apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and loss of host viability.\n\n\n\n\nWhat a Tangled Food Web We Weave\n\n\n\n\nBoth direct and indirect effects can mediate bottom-up influences on the \ndiversity and complexity of a food web. Bukovinszky et al. \n(p. 804) \ncompared the effects of two related plants (domestic Brussels sprouts and \nferal Brassica) on their aphid herbivores, the aphids' parasitoid \nwasps, and the wasps' secondary parasitoids to examine how resource quality\naffects food web structure and complexity. In this multilevel trophic \nsystem, differences in the resource base cascaded through the system, via \nan array of direct and indirect effects, and led to substantial differences\nin the structure and complexity of the resulting food webs.\n\n\n\n\nA Growing Role for Centrosomes\n\n\n\n\nGenetic analyses of individuals with extreme forms of short stature can \nprovide insights into the biological mechanisms regulating human growth. \nRauch et al. (p. 816, \npublished online 3 January; see the Perspective by Delaval and\nDoxsey) have identified a mutant gene responsible for microcephalic \nosteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (MOPD II). Adults with this \nrare inherited condition reach an average height of 100 centimeters, and \nalthough their brain is comparable in size to that of a three-month-old \nbaby, they are of nearnormal intelligence. The culprit gene is \nPCNT, which encodes pericentrin, a centrosomal protein implicated \nin mitotic spindle anchoring and chromosome separation during cell \ndivision. Although the precise mechanisms by which the cellular phenotype \nproduces the size phenotype remains to be determined, it is intriguing that\nother inherited forms of microcephaly (disorders characterized by small \nbrain size) have likewise been genetically linked to centrosomal and \nmitotic spindle genes.\nCREDIT: RAUCH ET \nAL.\n\n\n\n\nTipping the Balance in T Cell Decisions\n\n\n\n\nIn the thymus, key developmental decisions are made that have far-reaching \nconsequences for the immune system, perhaps most notable the commitment of \nthymocytes to becoming CD4 (helper) or CD8 (cytotoxic) T cells. The \ntranscriptional factor Th-POK commits thymocytes that still express both \nCD4 and CD8 co-receptors to becoming CD4 T cells, but how is the alternate \ndevelopmental option generated? Setoguchi et al. (p. 822) \nfind that cells that would otherwise be destined to become CD8+ T cells can\nbe redirected to the CD4 lineage by loss of members of another \ntranscription factor family, Runx. It seems that under normal \ncircumstances, the Runx complex represses Th-POK expression and allows CD8 \nT cells to emerge.\n\n\n\n\nThe Heme Balancing Act\n\n\n\n\nHeme, a component of several hemoproteins, is required in aerobic cells for\noxygen transport and storage (hemoglobin and myoglobin), electron transfer \nand drug metabolism (cytochromes), and signal transduction (nitric oxide \nsynthases). However, free heme is toxic, so its intracellular concentration\nmust be carefully regulated. Keel et al. (p. 825) \nhave generated mice lacking the heme export protein FLVCR (feline leukemia \nvirus, subgroup C, receptor), and show that this factor is required for \nterminal red blood cell development. They suggest that heme toxicity may be\na common pathophysiology in some erythroid disorders where \nfree-heme-balance is perturbed. Additionally, FLVCR functions in the \nrecycling of heme-iron from senescent red cells, and heme-iron trafficking \nvia FLVCR is involved in systemic iron homeostasis.\n\n\n\n\nUneven Heat Gain\n\n\n\n\nRecent global warming will not be, and has not been, uniform across all \nregions. In order to predict more accurately what the impacts of warming \nwill be, the spatial pattern of temperature change needs to be understood. \nLozier et al. (p. 800, \npublished online 3 January) examined how the North Atlantic has gained heat\nduring the past 50 years. The total amount of heat gained within the basin \nis approximately what would be expected, but the tropics and subtropics \nhave warmed while the sub-polar ocean has cooled. These results are \ninterpreted with the help of an ocean general circulation model to be \nmostly the result of wind and buoyancy forcing associated with the North \nAtlantic Oscillation. Although the spatial pattern of temperature change in\nthe North Atlantic does not directly reflect global warming, it may be the \nindirect result of warming as transmitted through large-scale changes in \natmospheric circulation.\n\n\n\n\nNanoscale 3D Imaging\n\n\n\n\n\"Super-resolution\" fluorescence microscopy methods are capable of\nbreaking the diffraction limit of resolution in conventional light \nmicroscopy of 200 to 300 nanometers (nm). These techniques have improved \ntwo-dimensional (2D) image resolution, but achieving 3D nanoscale \nresolution has remained a challenge. Huang et al. (p. 810, \npublished online 3 January) have used an optical astigmatism method to \ndevelop 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM). They \nexamined intracellular clathrin-coated pits and microtubules with an image \nresolution of 20 to 30 nm in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nm in the \naxial dimension in fixed cells.\n\n\n\n\nSpecifying Gene Expression\n\n\n\n\nThe efficiency of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II is modulated by \nthe composition of promoter chromatin, including the presence of \nnucleosome-binding proteins. Using a genomic approach, Krishnakumar \net al. (p. 819) \nshow that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and the linker histone H1,\ntwo nucleosome-binding proteins that compete for binding to nucleosomes in \nvitro, exhibit a reciprocal pattern of binding at many promoters in vivo. \nAt positively regulated promoters, PARP-1 is bound but H1 is not. Thus, \npromoter localization patterns of nucleosome-binding factors can specify \nglobal gene expression outcomes in vivo.\n\n\n\n\nRelatedness and Reproductive Success\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that marrying your cousin may not be such a bad idea, provided \nthere is sufficient distance in the degree of your relatedness. Helgason\net al. (p. 813) \nanalyzed recorded genealogies of 10 generations of Icelanders to test the \neffect of relatedness on reproductive success. Marriages between third and \nfourth cousins produced more children and more grandchildren than marriages\nbetween more highly related or less related people. Icelandic society has \nurbanized during the past 200 years with rural populations moving into \nurban areas, and the relatedness of married couples has diminished, which \nhas been accompanied by a drop in reproductive success.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsubscribe or edit your subscriptions for this service at:\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/alerts/main\n\nWritten requests to unsubscribe may be sent to:\nCustomer Service, 1454 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304, U.S.A.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nMagazine  |  News  |  Signaling\n|  Careers  |  Multimedia  |  Collections  |  Help  \n|  Site Map | RSS\nSubscribe  |  Feedback  |  Privacy / Legal  |  About Us  | Advertise With Us  |  Contact Us\n\n\u00a9 2008 American Association for the Advancement of \nScience.\u00a0All Rights Reserved.AAAS is a partner of HINARI,\nAGORA, PatientInform, CrossRef, \nand COUNTER.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://www.sciencemag.org/content/vol319/issue5864/twis.dtl']\n    additional_emails: []\n\n    sender_name: johvdvu-tqrpv\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 12:36:04 -0800\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 80, "explanation": "Legitimate email from a scientific institution with no obvious red flags.

I would let a lap DS surgeon get 50 procedures under his belt before I would put myself at his mercy. Let someone else be the trial dummies. Get someone experienced.

(I spoke with a lady who had a consult with him who was set on the DS - he did a pretty aggressive sell on distal RNY to her.  She ended up choosing a different surgeon.)  That's been quite some time ago now, though. The list at www.duodenalswitch.com   is the list of surgeons I would consider sound.  There are a lot of surgeons who will put themselves out there as doing the DS or having been trained in it - when they truly are not pro-DS at all.  OH's list is notorious for those types of listings.  I know they tried to clean the list up a bit about a year ago or so, but it's still concerning to me that so many people get fed a TON of misinformation about the DS when they contact some of those listed there! Maybe it would be a good idea to call their office and ask some pointed questions: 1.\tDoes the doctor offer the DS as a surgical procedure? 2.\tIf so, how many DS surgeries has he done (total)? 3.\tHow many open?  How many lap? 4.\tHow many Lap DS surgeries has he done in the past year? 5.\tHow many surgeries that started out Lap were converted to open? 6.\tWhat type of post-op follow-up does he have for DS post-ops? 7.\tHow many of his DS post-ops are willing to speak to prospective patients? 8.\tCan he share information about his feelings about surgical specs? (I.e., what size gastric sleeve does he leave?  What length alimentary limb? What length common channel?) Just to name a few.

It's my understanding that he's not working with Dr. Oh any longer. He had done more than a few DS when he was practicing in California and I had heard he was not opposed to the DS, and had wondered why so few folks in Washington were interested in the DS. I think he's done more DS, sure not certain about the lap numbers, though. Washington could sure use a good DS surgeon that was regularly performing the DS, that's for sure!

{"analysis_timestamp": "2025-07-25T16:32:43.058356", "user_prompt": "\n    From: ppcwedbyff@gmail.com\n    Subject: [Python-Dev] April 1-15, 2007 Summaries Final Draft\n\n    Body:\n    -------\n    If no one has any further comments over the weekend and Monday, I'll\npost it as the final summary that evening/night.\n\n=============\nAnnouncements\n=============\n\n=========\nSummaries\n=========\n\n---------------\nAbout SSL tests\n---------------\n\nAn open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep\nopen. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a\n'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the\nterminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform\nSubprocess Termination`).\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `About SSL tests\n`__\n\n-------------------------------------\nCross-Platform Subprocess Termination\n-------------------------------------\n\nBecause os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows\nplatforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows\nplatforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.\nSupport was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-\nplatform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually\nincorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was\ngiven.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)\n\n------------------------\nExtended buffer protocol\n------------------------\n\nUpdates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP\ndocumenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the\nplans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.\n\n(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real\ndegree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants\nto add to the summary, it will stay short.)\n\nContributing threads:\n\n- `Extended buffer PEP\n`__\n- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)\n`__\n- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples\n`__\n\n-----------------------------------------\nfunction for counting items in a sequence\n-----------------------------------------\n\nA patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),\nimplemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping\nbetween items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were\nsuggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of\nitems not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning\ndue to a just-makes-sense factor.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `function for counting items in a sequence\n`__\n\n----------------------------------------\ncontext manager - generator interaction?\n----------------------------------------\n\nA problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside\nthe with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context\nmanager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist\nwithout the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of\na formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `context manager - generator interaction?\n`__\n\n-----------------------------\nproposed which.py replacement\n-----------------------------\n\nSuggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to\nits proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have\nyet to be provided.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `proposed which.py replacement\n`_\n\n-----------------------\nminidom and DOM level 2\n-----------------------\n\nWhat is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and\nsome work jumpstarted.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `minidom and DOM level 2\n`__\n\n----------------------------------------------\ntest_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?\n----------------------------------------------\n\nDiffering buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose\nmode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes\nbefore a waitpid() call.\n\nContributing thread:\n\n- `test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?\n`__\n\n-------------------------\nHTTP Responses and Errors\n-------------------------\n\nIn 2xx HTTP responses mean that the request was handled OK.  The\nexisting library was special-casing the most common responses and\ntreating others as errors.

Once you know that it  may be possible to decode the pattern to discover what is being found in  your logwatch mail. It may also be possible to instruct your system to  not scan mail from logwatch. dp ------------------------------ >From buddgrbonu@gmail.com  Sun Feb 24 10:27:38 2008 Message: 5 Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2008 16:20:40 +0200 From: T?r?k Edwin  Subject: Re: [Clamav-users] Clamdscan not find viruses To: ClamAV users ML  Message-ID: <47AB13B8.1020406@gmail.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Rick Macdougall wrote: > Hi, > > I have another example where clamdscan fails to find a virus but  > clamscan does. > > > I have a copy of the message in question if one of the devs would like a  > copy. > >    Please open a bugreport, and attach the sample (marked as private).

PhishingScanURLs was no (hard coded), changing it to yes  makes clamdscan see it. How ever the reason I saw it was because a message came in on mail  server 3 last night and was not caught, but the message was then  forwarded to a user on mail server 2 where it was rejected by clamdscan. Now, mail server 2 did not see the virus this morning when I checked it  again but it obviously did last night when PhishingScanURLs = no. Any reason for that that you can see ?

As part of discussion in the tracker, Martin suggested that\npython-dev should discuss the change.\n\nCurrently, os.rename() on windows uses the API MoveFile() which fails\nif the destination file exists. The patch replaces this API with\nMoveFileEx() and uses the flag MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING which causes\nthe destination file to be replaced if it exists. However, this change\nis subtle and if there is any existing code that depends on current\nos.rename behaviour on windows, their code is silently broken with\n(any) destination file being overwritten. But the functionality of\nreplacing is important and I would like to know the best of way of\nsupporting it. If it is deemed that this change is not good to go in\nas-is, how about having an optional parameter to os.rename (say,\nwin_replace) that can be used by callers to explicitly request\nreplacing?\n\nI must also point out that the patch uses another flag\nMOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED effectively allowing renamed files to be on\nseparate file systems. The renaming in this case is not atomic and I\nused this flag only to support current functionality. It is not a bad\nidea to disallow such renames which brings it in line with the\nbehaviour on many unix flavors. This also has the potential to break\ncode but not silently.\n\nLastly, I found an old discussion about the same topic by this list.\n\nhttp://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-May/014957.html\n\nEven though Guido indicated that he doesn't support API change in this\nthread, I am posting again as I did not see any one mention\nMoveFileEx() in that thread.\n\nThanks,\nRaghu.\n_______________________________________________\nPython-Dev mailing list\nzvllln-eum@python.org\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev\nUnsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://www.python.org/sf/1704547)']\n    additional_emails: ['zvllln-eum@python.org']\n\n    sender_name: Raghuram Devarakonda\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 19:43:58 -0400\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 95, "explanation": "Spoofed sender address but no other red flags found", "recommendation": "Allow email to pass through", "urls": ["http://www.python.org/sf/1704547"], "url_check_results": [{"is_malicious": false, "url": "http://www.python.org/sf/1704547", "confidence": 0.5, "details": "Not blacklisted"}]}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

Once \nyour old messages have all been learned, you need to feed to it only new \narrivals, that is since the last sa-learn run. No need to keep 180 days worth \nof ham and spam in the temp folder!\n\n\nLet sa-learn complete and then chop the folder. Just concatenate the process \nrather than schedule it in crontab.

Hi.  Most likely this is a case of overfitting (overtraining):  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting): \"especially in cases where  learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, the  learner may adjust to very specific random features of the training data,  that have no causal relation to the target function.\"  Overfitting in back-propagation neural networks like MLP (resulting in  prediction bias toward one/some of the target classes) can be caused by the  following: if misclassified training instances continue to be misclassified  iteration after iteration, they get overweighted and actually take weight  from the correctly classified instances, i.e. the weights become  imbalanced. Furthermore, if misclassified instances happen to be clearly  concentrated to some classes, this can result in confusion matrix that you  quoted (zero correct instances for some classes).  > I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this.  MLP describes the parameters as follows: \"learningRate -- The amount the  weights are updated. momentum -- Momentum applied to the weights during  updating. decay -- This will cause the learning rate to decrease. This will  divide the starting learning rate by the epoch number, to determine what  the current learning rate should be. This may help to stop the network from  diverging from the target output, as well as improve general performance.\"  As far as I know, no off-the-shelf formula exists for optimizing these  parameters. It is an interchange of parameters and the dataset. If you are  looking for a pattern in performance, consider that the parameters operate  together (learning rate * momentum / decay) so that the first two operate  for controlling speed of change and the latter for stopping the change.  \"Ultimately, the cost function will depend on the task we wish to perform.\"  (wiki). If you are getting as high as > 85% accuracies from most  configurations, this suggests that optimal training model for this dataset  is produced when the parameters are set on 'fast burn' (few iterations) so  I would say higher learning rate * momentum and fast decay work best (do  they?).

And, POSIX.1 says, \"If \nnewpath already exists it will be atomically replaced (subject to\na few conditions; see ERRORS below), so that there is no point at which \nanother process attempting to access newpath will find it missing.\" \nClearly, unliking and then calling MoveFile is not atomic. So, cygwin is \nnot being honest here because in these less frequent cases, the rename \nwill not be atomic.\n\nAlso note, MVCRT only tries step 1 of cygwin's version. Which I believe \nalso suggests that it's the only version that is atomic.\n\n-Scott\n\n-- \nScott Dial\nhmigv@scottdial.com\nscodial@cs.indiana.edu\n_______________________________________________\nPython-Dev mailing list\nzvllln-eum@python.org\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev\nUnsubscribe: http://mail.python.org/mailman/options/python-dev/python-dev%40tangomu.com\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev']\n    additional_emails: ['hmigv@scottdial.com', 'zvllln-eum@python.org', 'scodial@cs.indiana.edu']\n\n    sender_name: Scott Dial\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 19:22:53 -0400\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 80, "explanation": "Spoofed sender address, but legitimate email list URL and known email addresses", "recommendation": "Proceed with caution", "urls": ["http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev"], "url_check_results": [{"is_malicious": false, "url": "http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev", "confidence": 0.5, "details": "Not blacklisted"}]}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

I thought  \nthere might be some academic interest here, and that I'd share with  \nthe list in return for the great code of yours that I used.\n\nThe overall assignment was to \"do something with evolutionary  \nalgorithms.\"  The goal of my project was more or less to attack a  \nspam filter and attempt to use an EA to find weaknesses it might  \nhave.  I set up a blind watchmaker sort of natural selection/ \nevolution environment using a SpamBayes filter that I had trained on  \nan old training corpus as the fitness function.  The program I wrote  \nattempted to evolve a generic formula that worked sort of like  \n\"MadLibs\" to write spam emails that could get past the filter.  I  \nstarted off with almost zero knowledge of how a spam filter works,  \nand tried to keep it that way while I wrote the algorithm so that it  \nwould be as naive as possible.  I've since read up on SpamBayes and  \nsome of the math behind it, and it looks really interesting.  I'm  \nlooking forward to taking more time to look through the codebase.\n\nNow that the project is completed, I see where I could have trained  \nthe filter on different content or parts of the evolution structure  \nthat I could have written differently to make this project more  \nsuccessful, but that's research for you!  This was a very quick proof  \nof concept project, and if I were to continue with this research  \nthere are certainly a lot of things I would do differently and many  \nmore complicated techniques that I'd like to try.\n\nIf anyone is interested in reading about the project in more detail,  \nI've posted the paper I wrote here:\nhttp://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~egifford/classes/egiffordTermProject.pdf\n\nThanks again for maintaining this cool project.  I hope you'll take  \nmy contribution in the intellectual sense that is intended, and not  \nas an attack. :)\n\nLiz Gifford\n_______________________________________________\nspambayes-dev mailing list\nbsfegmjrr-hnq@python.org\nhttp://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/spambayes-dev\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/']\n    additional_emails: ['bsfegmjrr-hnq@python.org']\n\n    sender_name: Elizabeth Gifford\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 19:49:09 -0400\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 95, "explanation": "The email appears to be from a legitimate sender who has used SpamBayes for a class project.

Sometimes mail attachments are truncated and and e-mail is send but files are corrupted.  Mail header contains then: \"X-Amavis-Alert: BAD HEADER MIME error: error: part did not end with expected boundary\". And that is true - there is no boundary for MIME and data stream is not completed. I've turned on detailed postfix debugging and it looks like at some point there is:   smtp_get: EOF instead of:  < some_IP: QUIT  > some_IP: 221 2.0.0 Bye Attachment is truncated after different sizes (sometimes 65kB, sometimes 200kB) and after different times (25s, 100s). The only common thing I've found is that all such mails come from one internet provider that is public-gprs*.centertel.pl I guess it might be the problem with this provider (Orange Poland) but on the other hand they can send e-mails through other mail servers without such a problem. I got stuck with it. Is there any way to debug it more? Do you have any ideas what could be the cause? I use postfix 2.3.8 on Debian Stable + amavis etc. Thanks in advance!

For starters, Edmund M. Clarke, E. Allen Emerson, and Joseph Sifakis received the 2007 Turing Award, the granddaddy of all computing awards, for their work on model checking, an automated technique for finding design errors in complex hardware and software. They share a $250,000 prize.\nMoving from computing to mathematics, Pierre Deligne, Phillip Griffiths, and David Mumford are sharing the 2008 Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics. Deligne was honored \"for his work on mixed Hodge theory, the Weil conjectures, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and for his contributions to arithmetic,\" Griffiths \"for his work on variations of Hodge structures; the theory of periods of abelian integrals; and for his contributions to complex differential geometry,\" and Mumford \"for his work on algebraic surfaces; on geometric invariant theory; and for laying the foundations of the modern algebraic theory of moduli of curves and theta functions.\" The three share a $100,000 award.\nThis year's Crafoord Prize combined the fields of abstract mathematics with astrophysics. Maxim Kontsevich and Edward Witten received the 2008 Crafoord Prize in Mathematics from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, while Rashid Sunyaev received the Crafoord Prize in Astronomy. Kontsevich and Witten were cited \"for their important contributions to mathematics inspired by modern theoretical physics.\" Half of the $500,000 prize goes to Kontsevich and Witten, the other half to Sunyaev.\nBack in the field of computing, the 2007 Gordon Bell Prize went to a team of scientists--Kyle Caspersen, James Glosli, John Gunnels, David Richards, Robert Rudd, and Frederick Streitz--from Lawrence Livermore National Lab and IBM for a unique simulation of a phenomenon known as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the BlueGene/L. These gents will divvy up a $10,000 prize.\nAnd finally, there's the Dr. Dobb's Excellence In Programming Award, given this year to....uh, I can't tell you. It is still a secret. But the recipient will be honored in the upcoming April 2008 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal and in person at the SD West 2008 Conference on Wednesday, March 5, 2008. For a list of previous recipients, visit Dr. Dobb's Hall of Fame. \nCongratulations to one and all for well-deserved honors.\n-- Jonathan Erickson\nwomjcgkea@ddj.com\nNew Features\n\n\nContinuous Integration and Performance Testing\nSteven extends continuous integration to perform integration, performance, and load testing.\n\nThe Impact of AJAX on the Network\nAJAX is one of the most exciting--and disruptive--programmatic innovations of the past few years.\n\nPyCon 2008 Conference\nDr. Dobb's Journal interviews David Goodger, Chair of the PyCon 2008 Developer Conference to be held in Chicago March 14-16, 2008.

Nugache, sophisticated rootkits and ransomware have all made headlines. Now, after quietly falling off the radar, PDF spam could be making a comeback. Last week, MX Logic, an antispam and managed services vendor, reported that it is tracking PDF spam found in unwanted messages. As part of our Seacurity Wire Weekly podcast series, Sam Masiello, director of threat\n management at MX Logic, offered his opinions on why the format has resurfaced, how security researchers found it and whether an increase in PDF spam is likely. Also, security researchers at Facetime Communications warn of a new do-it-yourself phishing program that assists phishers in attacking social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook.\n\nThe network access control (NAC) market was the topic of choice in our Jan. 23rd Security Wire Weekly edition. Dave Bixler, CISO for Siemens IT Solutions and Services, talks about the state of the network access control market, where NAC technology is headed and why he thinks it's smart for organizations to hold off on NAC deployments. \n\nIn our first Security Squad podcast of the New Year, the SearchSecurity.com editors discussed the likelihood of a massive cyberattack in 2008. The team also examines the Sears spyware scandal.  \n\nIn last month's Threat Monitor podcast, security threats expert Ed Skoudis unveiled what he thinks will be the biggest security threats in 2008, and offers advice on how corporations can defend against them. Some of the threats mentioned include spear-phishing, botnets and malware email attacks. \n\nBe sure to check out our brand-new Compliance School podcast, Fact or fiction: Involving end users in the compliance program. Richard E. Mackey, vice president of consultancy SystemExperts, discloses the tools needed to educate end users about the importance of compliance, how users can get involved in the compliance program and why compliance is an essential aspect of corporate risk management.\n\nWe're adding new recordings all the time, so remember, you can visit our audio downloads page at any time to listen to all of our security podcasts and subscribe to our podcast feeds.\n\nHave a great weekend! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0SITE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo center: Information security governance\n\n        Ensure that your organization's tools, people and business processes meet all of your information security needs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0PODCASTS & WEBCASTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebcast: Best practices for database security and compliance\n\n\nWHEN:\u00a0\u00a0\nFeb. 13th, 2:00 p.m. ET (19:00 GMT)\n\n\nSPEAKERS:\u00a0\u00a0\nNoel Yuhanna, Principal Analyst\n\n\n\u00a0\nPhil Neray, v.p. of Marketing, Guardium\n\n\nSPONSOR:\u00a0\u00a0\nGuardium, Inc.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWebcast: Three things you didn't know about the PCI DSS and your Web application's security\n\n\nWHEN:\u00a0\u00a0\nFeb. 12th, 2:00 p.m. ET (19:00 GMT)\n\n\nSPEAKER:\u00a0\u00a0\nDave Cronin, Director, Worldwide Channels, Breach Security\n\n\nSPONSOR:\u00a0\u00a0\nBreach Security\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nWebcast: Making risk standards work for you\n\n\nWHEN:\u00a0\u00a0\nAvailable on demand\n\n\nSPEAKER:\u00a0\u00a0\nJeff Reich, CSO, Rackspace Managed Hosting\n\n\nSPONSOR:\u00a0\u00a0\nnetForensics\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nFact or fiction: Involving end users in the compliance program\n\n\nWHEN:\u00a0\u00a0\nAvailable on demand\n\n\nSPEAKER:\u00a0\u00a0\nRichard E.

This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.\n\n2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py\n\n3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.\n\nThis is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>Comment By: Skip Montanaro (montanaro)\nDate: 2007-05-10 21:26\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=44345\nOriginator: NO\n\nI'm a little curious about the -C flag.  The code reads:\n\n         elif opt in (\"-c\", \"--cullext\"):\n             cullext = arg\n         elif opt in (\"-C\", \"--cullext\"):\n             cullext = ''\nIn general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. \nThanks for that...  A couple comments:\n\n* The \"--cullext\" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have\n\"--cull\" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. \nLet me know if you have a different change in mind.\n\n* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in\ncase he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it\nclosed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take\nissue with.\n\n* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)\n\nSkip\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment By: David Abrahams (david_abrahams)\nDate: 2007-05-10 20:18\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=52572\nOriginator: YES\n\nGreat!

This site is simply like no other. \nIACmusic.com is an indie all-star site, it recently got mention in\nRolling Stone, and has been called the online world's most innovative\nmusic portal.  We reach out to bring in artists who are truly creative\nwith influences vast.  Cashbox found the quality of music on the site so\noutstanding that now all content on their Indie Charts comes directly\nfrom IAC.   Our traffic is huge and growing, word of mouth is off the\nhook, and our station set-up is years beyond any other music site. \nMeanwhile, our community is thriving with station managers who actively\npounce on the new releases and will help promote your songs for you.\nAlso, IAC stations will soon be available to listen to via any cellphone\nwith our recent move into that arena. \nWe are about the music and indie culture.   No cookie-cutters were used\nin the making of this site.  IAC is colorful and magical, to reflect the\ncreativity of the artists themselves.  If you choose, you can sell your\ndownloads, set your own price and you get 100% of the take.  You can\nbuild digital CDs called DMDs which include the revolutionary IAC\nUltrapage.  IAC's dedicated support department is always there to answer\nyour questions.  Check out the site here.  If you want to find real\nlisteners, this is the place to do it. \nHere's a direct shortcut to start a free page.  Any additional exposure\nwill help you get your music to the world. \nHope to hear your songs at IAC soon! \nToby, a&r - IACmusic.com \n_______________________________________________\nTo unsubscribe or change your e-mail preferences for the Dixieland Jazz Mailing list, or to find the online archives, please visit:\n\nhttp://ml.islandnet.com/mailman/listinfo/dixielandjazz\n\n\n\nDixielandjazz mailing list\nDixielandjazz@ml.islandnet.com\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://APlaceForJazz.org']\n    additional_emails: ['Dixielandjazz@ml.islandnet.com', 'jerrygordon@juno.com', 'music@ridethekiac.com']\n\n    sender_name: Jerry Gordon\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 14:31:22 -0400\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 0, "explanation": "The email appears to be legitimate, but it's always best to exercise caution when receiving unsolicited emails with links or requests for sensitive information.", "recommendation": "If you're interested in learning more about the music site, visit http://APlaceForJazz.org and explore their offerings.", "urls": ["http://APlaceForJazz.org"], "url_check_results": [{"is_malicious": false, "url": "http://APlaceForJazz.org", "confidence": 0.5, "details": "Not blacklisted"}]}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

Currently serves the web interface only.  Plugging in listeners for various protocols is TBD.  This is a first cut at creating a standalone server which uses a plugin architecture to support different protocols.  The primary motivation is that web apps like MoinMoin, Trac and Roundup can use spam detection, but they don't necessarily provide the mechanisms necessary to save ham and spam databases for retraining.  By providing protocol plugins you should be able to fairly easily provide (for example) an XML-RPC interface web apps can use.  The core server takes care of all the training bells and whistles.

But I just want to check that is what was meant by the  \n> wording.)\n\nI believe \"veto\" is giving the wrong idea here as something that\nhappens after the fact.  What's the term for only allowing \"acceptable\"\ncandidates to put their names on the ballot?  Anyway, as TSa surmises,\nthe ballot is vetted or stacked in advance--only those candidates\nthat *could* bind are considered to be part of the candidate set.\nIn the abstract, candidates that cannot match never get their names\non the ballot, though of course an implementation might choose to\ndetermine this lazily as long as it preserves the same semantics.\n\nAlternately, even if the list of valid candidates is determined\neagerly, if the candidate list construction is memoized based on the\ntypeshape of the Capture, it will generally not have to be redone\nuntil you see a different typeshape (where the meaning of \"different\"\nmay depend on how specific the signatures are, and in particular on\nwhether any of the signatures rely on subset constraints (including\nindividual values, which are just degenerate subsets)).\n\nLarry\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: No URLs identified\n    additional_emails: []\n\n    sender_name: Larry Wall\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 12:01:29 -0700\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 100, "explanation": "Legitimate email from Larry Wall about multiple dispatch in Rust.", "recommendation": "This is a legitimate email.", "urls": [], "url_check_results": []}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

To fully leverage this new class of multi-core hardware, software developers must change the way they create applications. By turning their focus to multi-threaded applications, developers will be able to take full advantage of multi-core devices and deliver software that meets the demands of the world. But this paradigm of multi-threaded software development adds a new wrinkle of complexity for those who care the utmost about software quality. \n                 Click Here to View This Whitepaper\n\n\n\n\n  \nJMS Performance Benchmarks  \n            \nThis paper presents a performance analysis of publish/subscribe messaging throughput of FioranoMQ\u00ae 2007, Sonic MQ 7.0, Tibco EMS v4.4.0 and ActiveMQ 4.1.0.

If so, you should be writing software at Airwave\nWireless. Our team practices extreme programming (XP), so we spend most of\nour time writing code. We believe that running code and short feedback\nloops speak louder than excessive documentation and month-long design\nmeetings. We practice test-driven development and have a comprehensive\nsuite of tests... over 31,000 at last count. We pair program, so you'll\nlearn the system quickly and have a great time doing it. We have short\nrelease cycles, which means your talents\nwon't sit idle working on projects that never see the light of day.\nSoftware you write today will be managing enterprise networks in just a\ncouple of weeks. We've been cited as the longest running continuous XP\nproject in the\nindustry (six years and counting), so we have gotten quite good at\nembracing XP's advantages while avoiding its pitfalls.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy working at Airwave more than any job I've ever had.  I\nam excited to come into work every day, I work hard for eight hours solving\nchallenging problems, and then go home to lead a well balanced life outside\n\nof work.  When I'm at work I get to interact closely with a group that is\nbrilliant, funny, motivated, and inspiring.  I spend most of the day\nsmiling, laughing, and learning.  The team we've built is truly a special\ngroup, and I'm proud and honored to be a part of it.\n\nExcited? Good! Now to the nuts and bolts. Airwave developers write software\nin several different languages, primarily object-oriented Perl on Linux\nsystems. We\nuse Apache mod_perl2 for our front end UI and PostgreSQL for our back-end\npersistence layer. Since we manage network devices, knowledge of network\nprotocols would be a plus, e.g. SNMP, TFTP, and HTTP.\n\nRolling out a wireless network is a daunting task, but our products help to\nease that burden. We build network management software that is used by many\nof the\nleading IT organizations at Fortune 500 companies, major universities,\nhospitals, and other prominent institutions. Our industry-leading software\nhelps plan, configure, manage, and monitor some of the largest wireless\nnetworks on the planet.\n\nRequired skills:\n * Perl\n * Object-oriented programming\n * Strong refactoring and design ability\n\nDesired skills:\n * Experience developing automated tests\n * Apache mod_perl\n * Basic SQL (PostgreSQL experience a plus)\n * Experience with agile software development\n * Function or logical programming expeience\n * Linux application development\n * Knowledge of TCP/IP and 802.11 wireless networking\n\nContact information at:\nhttp://jobs.perl.org/job/7902#contact\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://jobs.perl.org/job/7902']\n    additional_emails: ['jobs-unsubscribe@perl.org', 'jobs-subscribe@perl.org']\n\n    sender_name: Perl Jobs\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 11:57:45 -0800\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 90, "explanation": "The email appears to be a legitimate job posting from a reputable organization (Perl Jobs).

And every year they do not fail to impress.\n\nPast finds have included a 1900 blueprint for a proposed expansion of the White House; a 1906 photograph of baseball great Cy Young; a typescript of Cole Porter's 1916 debut Broadway musical, \"See America First\"; a 1954 home movie of Marilyn Monroe; and an orchestral score by Jerry Goldsmith for the 1968 film \"Planet of the Apes.\"\n\nThis year, 200 items were showcased, including Copies of the Virginia and New Jersey Plans (1787) upon which the current bicameral U.S. political system is based; a map of the proposed U.S. Capitol grounds by F.C. De Krafft (1822); selected items from the Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Collection (1841-1935); the April 21, 1865, issue of the Weekly National Republican, which details Abraham Lincoln's assassination and its aftermath; a rare first-edition piece of instrumental sheet music for the \"Maple Leaf Rag\" by Scott Joplin (1899); a rare print of \"The Rajah's Casket\" (1906) by Pathe Freres, one of the first companies to experiment with the use of hand-coloring in motion pictures; and items pertaining to the 1929 film \"Applause,\" directed by Rouben Mamoulian, along with personal snapshots of the director on holiday with Greta Garbo.\n\nCheck out some highlights after the jump.\n\nA clip from a video at the beginning of the display. This Google Earth tour showed the home cities of all of the Junior Fellows, along with some personal information about each. The full tour can be found via Google Earth, here  [ http://www.loc.gov/extranet/paodocs/2008jrfellows/2008-Library-of-Congress-Junior-Fellow-Tour.kml ](link opens in Google Earth).\n\nJunior Fellows Display at the Library of Congress [ http://www.loc.gov/extranet/paodocs/2008jrfellows/newspapers-serials.jpg ]\n\nJunior Fellows display discoveries from the Serials and Government Publications Division.\n\nJunior Fellows Display at the Library of Congress [ http://www.loc.gov/extranet/paodocs/2008jrfellows/g-men.jpg ]\n\nThis first edition of \"G-Men\" (1935-1953), published in October 1935, featured an article praising FBI Director J.

The ragtime was adapted from Robert Schumann's \"Traeumerei,\" or \"Reverie.\"\n\nAnd finally, a brief video clip.\n\nDuring the silent era, earlier films by popular artists were edited together to create new releases. \"The Rounders\" (1914), starring Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977) and Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle (1887-1933), and another unidentified Chaplin film were re-cut, given new title cards, and combined to create \"Greenwich Village.\" (\"Greenwich Village,\" ca. 1922. 35mm black-and-white safety print from original film.

Sorry, I didn't post an update because I was embarrassed at my own\nstupidity for not thinking it through more carefully before posting my\noriginal message. Switching the jobs round did indeed mean that sa-learn\nis no longer getting interfered with by archivemail while it's in\nmid-learn. It now behaves quite sensibly.\n\n>> Well, as I explained in my previous post, the \"TempHam\" folder is a\n>> concatenation of all my non-spam folders.

I know that it only needs to learn the *new* mails. It's just that\nI'm basically lazy, and it seemed far easier for me simply to take all\nmy non-spam folders and copy them together into one big temporary\nfile, run sa-learn on it and then delete the temporary file, eg:\n\n#!/bin/bash\ncat ~/mail/mailinglists/* ~/mail/WorkStuff/* ~/mail/Admin/* > TempHam\nsa-learn --ham --mbox ~/mail/TempHam\nrm ~/mail/TempHam\n\nI'm no bash-scripting wiz (that much should be obvious!) so I could\nthink of no *easy* way to strip only today's mails out of my 20-odd\nfolders and just feed those to sa-learn. My way, I need to do nothing\nmyself, the job takes about half an hour, and I'm asleep when it\nhappens... OK, sa-learn has to work a bit harder than it needs to, but\nhey, better it than me!\n\nThe 180 days thing is because I choose to keep only the last 6 months\n(approx) mail in each of my 20 or so folders, the rest being zipped into a gzip\narchive using \"Archivemail\" (a very neat little utility btw) and 180 days is\nits default setting (see I told you I was lazy!).\n\n> Let sa-learn complete and then chop the folder.

Tell \nthem:\n- you will whitelist them (so you're very open)\n- but you don't want anyone else to be whitelisted. so they must own the IP\n- they must take responsibility for all mail coming out of that IP\n- they may have delivery issues elsewhere. they may not realize it, but \nsome sites may be discarding their mail. And if that didn't happen yet, \nchances are this will happen in the future. Many people are getting sick \nof supporting zombies because of broken sites.\n\nIn short, their system is not configured according to the standards:\n- a helo name must be an fqdn hostname (or an IP literal)\n- their system must have a correct reverse DNS: IP->name->IP must result \nin the original IP.\n\n\n> Concerning removing reject_non_fqdn_hostname (or\n> reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname) is not something I want to do.

Is there a way could add an exception to the main.cf for this domain\n> or IP address?\n>   \n\nIt would have been easier if you showed your config. you need to put a \ncheck_client_access that returns OK but you must not put this in the \nwrong place.\n\nhere is an acceptable example:\n\nsmtpd_recipient_restrictions =\n    ...\n    reject_unauth_destination\n    reject_non_fqdn_sender\n    reject_non_fqdn_recipient\n    ...\n    reject_invalid_hostname\n    check_client_access cidr:/etc/postfix/broken_client\n    reject_non_fqdn_hostname\n    ...\n\n\n== broken_client\n10.1.2.3/32      OK\n\n\nIn short, you should move your reject_non_fqdn_hostname down enough to \nbe able to add the broken_client check before it without affecting other \nchecks.\n\na less appealing alternative is to make your reject_non_fqdn_hostname a \nresult of a check_client_access:\n\n==\n10.1.2.3/32      DUNNO\n0.0.0.0/0          reject_non_fqdn_hostname\n\nbut this will only add complexity.\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: No URLs identified\n    additional_emails: ['oyopvgi@ourdomain.com']\n\n    sender_name: mouss\n\n    date_received: Wed, 06 Aug 2008 01:06:19 +0100\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 80, "explanation": "Legitimate email with some red flags", "recommendation": "Respond to the client and ask for more information about their system configuration and why they believe their IP address or domain should be whitelisted.", "urls": [], "url_check_results": []}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

The plugin merely sets the\nresponder on/off and with a message.  Your mail delivery system does\nthe actual autoresponding.  You need to know how to configure your\nautoresponse system.  If you don't know how to do that, read up on\nyour mail system and ask in the right forum.

Meyer\n\nIIMS\n\nMassey University Auckland\n\nNew Zealand\n\n \n\nDear Dr. Meyer\n\n \n\nBentham Science Publishers have gained a longstanding international\nreputation for their excellent standards and top quality science\npublications. Many journals published by Bentham Science Publishers have\nreceived high impact factors in their respective fields. For the current\nlist of publications, please visit www.bentham.org. Seven Nobel Laureates\nhave endorsed a number of Bentham Science's journals; please read their\nquotes at www.bentham.org/Nobel.htm \n\n \n\nThe publishers are now undertaking a new publication venture by launching a\nnumber of Open Access journals in 2007, devoted to various disciplines in\nthe fields of science and technology.  \n\n \n\nOpen Access Journals are freely accessible via the Internet for immediate\nworldwide, open access to the full text of articles, serving the best\ninterests of the scientific community. All interested readers can read,\ndownload and/or print open access articles at no cost. There is no\nsubscription fee for Open Access journals.  The modest open access\npublication costs are usually covered by the author's institution or\nresearch funds. Moreover, authors who publish in our Open Access journals\nretain the copyright of their article. Open Access journals are no different\nfrom traditional subscription-based journals; they undergo the same\npeer-review process and quality control as any other scholarly journal.\n\n \n\nThe Open Artificial Intelligence Journal is an Open Access online journal,\nwhich publishes research articles, reviews and letters in all areas of\nartificial intelligence. Please visit the journal's homepage and\nInstructions for Authors for article submission at the following website\nwww.bentham.org/open/toaij \n\n \n\nThe journal aims to provide the most complete and reliable source of\ninformation on current developments in the field. The emphasis will be on\npublishing quality articles rapidly and making them freely available to the\nresearchers worldwide.

Contributions are welcome from any discipline concerned\nwith constraints, including artificial intelligence, combinatorial\nalgorithms, computational logic, concurrent computation, databases,\ndiscrete mathematics, operations research, programming languages, and\nsymbolic computation. We also solicit papers from any domain employing\nconstraints, including computational linguistics, configuration,\ndecision support, design, diagnosis, graphics, hardware verification,\nmolecular biology, planning, qualitative reasoning, real-time systems,\nresource allocation, robotics, scheduling, software engineering,\ntemporal reasoning, vision, visualization, and user interfaces. Papers\nthat bridge disciplines or combine theory and practice or discuss\nnovel reasoning methods are especially welcome. A special attention is\nfocused around the use of constraint technologies in the networking,\nwireless and internet fields.\n\n\n************************************************************************\nSUBMISSIONS\n\nWe would like to invite authors to submit papers on research on\nconstraint solving and programming, with particular emphasis on\nassessing the current state of the art and identifying future\ndirections.\n\nPreliminary guidelines:\nSubmissions should be properly anonymized to facilitate blind\nreviewing: papers being submitted should not list the authors,\naffiliations or addresses on the first page and authors are also\nencouraged to take care throughout the entire document to minimise\nreferences that may reveal the identity of the authors or\ninstitution. The body of each paper should not exceed 4,000\nwords. Papers failing to comply with length limitations risk immediate\nrejection.  At least three reviewers will be assigned to each\nsubmission to the track. Accepted papers are published by ACM in both\nprinted form and CD-ROM; they are also available on the Web through\nthe ACM Digital Library. Once accepted, papers must fit within five\n(5) two column pages (please check the author kit on the main SAC\nwebsite: the format is usually the format used in the ACM templates),\nwith the option (at additional expense) to add three (3) more pages.\nA second set of selected papers, which did not get accepted as full\npapers, will be accepted as posters and will be published as extended\n2-page abstracts in the symposium proceedings.\n\nAuthors of accepted papers must be prepared to sign a copyright\nstatement and must pay the registration fee and guarantee that their\npaper will be presented at the conference.\n\nPaper submissions should be sent (as an attached PDF file) to:\n\n               ayngnxt.ktvtegfzla@iit.cnr.it\n\nThe body of the email should include the title of the paper, the\nauthor(s) name(s) and affiliation(s), and the address (including\ne-mail, telephone, and fax) to which correspondence should be sent.\nThe subject of the email should be \"SAC2005 constraint track\nsubmission\" We strongly suggest to use for submission the available\ncamera ready templates, and adhere to the 5 page limitation.\n\nRegistration is required for paper and poster inclusion in the\nConference Proceedings, and for event attendance.\n\n\n\n************************************************************************\nIMPORTANT DATES\n\nThe proposed schedule of important dates for the track is as follows:\n\nPaper Submission deadline August 31, 2004\nNotification of acceptance October 18, 2004\nCamera-ready version deadline November 2, 2004\nTrack Dates March 13-17, 2005\n\n\n************************************************************************\nORGANISATION:\n\n\nOrganising Committee\n- --------------------\n\nStefano Bistarelli (Primary Contact)\n Dipartimento di Scienze\n Universit\u00e0 degli studi \"G.

It's good to be back from a long weekend in Vegas. I had a blast there--not only was the Super Bowl a great game all way to the last minute, but also I was able to do a lot of other things like celebrate a friend's birthday, and a friend's bachelor party, and even got to go see a live Ultimate Fighting Championship match! Talk about a fun filled guy's weekend The only downside, was while my mind helped me feel like I was 21 again, my body said, \"No way buddy!\" So I'm still recovering, but it was well worth it. Now it's back to being a daddy, and husband again. OK, enough about my weekend. Let's get started with Richard's question of how he can remove his hard drive partition.    \n\nThis week we received more than 60 submissions to Richard's question in regards to removing his hard drive partition. After reading all the answers, a huge percentage of you recommended a utility called Symantec's Norton Partition Magic to get the job done (second most mentioned was Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0). While I have never tried any of these utilities, I've always heard good things about them and how simple they are to use. However, these utilities don't come free, and will set you back some money. But if time is money, and the fastest way to get around this issue is to fork out some dough, I would buy it. So to get you started here are a few selected submissions for you to get going. But please, read through the other members' submissions. Some of you may come to realize that it might be worthwhile to wipe your hard drive clean and start over, or just to invest in a new hard drive all together. Before any of you do attempt to go through with this task, I would advise you to backup your data, just in case anything goes wrong. If you have any more questions, ask away. For those of you who have any other recommendations on this week's topic, join in on the discussion. Thank you for your contributions and have a wonderful weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers!Lee KooManager, CNET community\nGot suggestions?

Now, after\ncollecting many files, the C drive is more than 90 percent\nfull, making it difficult to operate.  I would like to remove\nthe partition and use the entire hard drive as the\nC drive, giving 80GB total. The computer has a second hard\ndrive I use for storage of 250GB. How do I remove the\npartition and still keep everything intact? What are my\noptions? Thanks so much for your help.  I am a retiree\nworking with genealogy and family history.

Below is the answer voted most helpful by our community to last week's question.\n\n \n\n\nHi everyone. I bought a Western Digital 200GB external hard\ndrive 90-plus days ago, and the buttons quit. I can't back \nup. I sent WD several e-mails, and no response from them. If\nI get another external hard drive, could I open this one, and\ntransfer data to the new external one from the old? How would\nI do this? Also: If this can be done, could the one I have\nthen be reformatted, put in a new casing? Does anyone know\nhow to repair these on/off/auto buttons? Will I lose\neverything I backed up to the WD external drive?  Please keep\nthe explanation simple, as I'm a 63-year-old 'Nanny', IRS\nReg. Tax Preparer.

I've always heard good things that can result from registry cleaners, but anytime some one mentions registry I cringe at the thought as I've heard that tweaking the Windows registry can easily go wrong and possibly kill my computer. Is this true? How about registry cleaners? Ultimately what can a registry cleaner do for me? Will I benefit from it? Is it safe? I think it time for me to face my fears with the registry. So can you kindly give me some pointers on the ins and outs about registry cleaners,  recommend some good ones that are free or paid, and what should I do to prepare myself for this task to ensure if I do decide to do some registry cleaning that I'm prepared for the worst to happen and recover gracefully.

Many of these people \nare forgoing doctors\u2019 visits or relying on emergency rooms for their medical \ncare, the study said.  \nThe report, based on an analysis of government health surveys of adults ages \n18 to 64 years old, estimated that about 11 million of the 36 million people \nwithout insurance in 2004 \u2014 the latest year of the study \u2014 had received a \nchronic-condition diagnosis.  \n\u201cThese are people who, with modern therapies, can be kept out of trouble,\u201d \nsaid Dr. Andrew P. Wilper, the study\u2019s lead author. Therapies for someone with \ndiabetes and hypertension \u201care routine and widely available, if you have \ninsurance,\u201d said Dr. Wilper, a medical instructor at the _University of Washington_ \n(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/universit\ny_of_washington/index.html?inline=nyt-org)  in Seattle. \nThe most recent government estimate of the number of people in this country \nwithout _health insurance_ \n(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=ny\nt-classifier)  is 47 million, which means that if the proportions found in \nthe study have remained constant, there might be nearly 16 million people in \nthis country with a chronic condition but no insurance to pay for medical care. \nNearly a quarter of the uninsured with a chronic illness who were surveyed \nsaid they had not visited a health professional within the last year. About 7 \npercent said they typically went to a hospital emergency room for care. \n\u201cA lot of people are suffering from a lack of health insurance,\u201d said Dr. \nSteffie Woolhandler, another of the study\u2019s authors, who is a physician and \nassociate professor of medicine at Harvard.  \nPeople with high blood pressure, for example, are at risk for catastrophic \nmedical events like a stroke if they are not getting the drugs they need or \nhaving a doctor monitor their disease, said Karen Davis, the president of the \nCommonwealth Fund. The fund, a foundation in New York that specializes in health \ncare research, has done its own research into the lack of adequate medical care \namong the uninsured.  \nThe study, being published Tuesday, may have underestimated exactly how many \npeople who are uninsured have a chronic illness, because it includes only \nthose who have already received such a diagnosis, the authors said. Individuals \nwho have not had their conditions diagnosed because they are not seeing a doctor \nor nurse are not included. \nThe study\u2019s authors say that their findings cast doubt on the common \nassumption that many of the uninsured tend to be young and healthy, requiring little \nin the way of medical care. Because so many actually have chronic conditions \nthat may be expensive to treat, the cost of covering the uninsured is often \nunderestimated, said Dr. Woolhandler, who advocates a nationalized system of \nhealth care.  \nIn Massachusetts, she said, the state\u2019s effort to overhaul its health \ninsurance system to cover more residents is costing much more than expected and has \nnot led to universal coverage because policy makers assumed that more people \nwould be healthy. \u201cThe state experiments have all failed because of cost,\u201d she \nsaid.  \nThe study describes harsh consequences for neglecting easily treatable \ndiseases in so many people. \u201cFor some of the 11.4 million uninsured Americans with \nserious chronic conditions, access to care seems to be unobtainable; many may \nface early disability and death as a result,\u201d the study\u2019s authors said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**************Looking for a car that's sporty, fun and fits in your budget? \nRead reviews on AOL Autos.      \n(http://autos.aol.com/cars-BMW-128-2008/expert-review?ncid=aolaut00050000000017 )\n\n---\nYou are currently subscribed to lwv-healthcare as: 1b10055440efac18fc80423f8be268d5@mail.reutter.co.uk.\nTo unsubscribe send a blank email to leave-799581-2905919.f98f1b2721e7d78ac4be9537845ff3f7@lists.lwv.org\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://www.nytimes.com/)']\n    additional_emails: ['leave-799581-2905919.f98f1b2721e7d78ac4be9537845ff3f7@lists.lwv.org', '1b10055440efac18fc80423f8be268d5@mail.reutter.co.uk']\n\n    sender_name: Poliric\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 20:09:45 -0400\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 0, "explanation": "The email is not suspicious and appears to be a genuine news article excerpt.", "recommendation": "Proceed with caution but consider the email legitimate.", "urls": ["http://www.nytimes.com/", "http://autos.aol.com/cars-BMW-128-2008/expert-review?ncid=aolaut00050000000017"], "url_check_results": [{"is_malicious": false, "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "confidence": 0.5, "details": null}, {"is_malicious": false, "url": "http://autos.aol.com/cars-BMW-128-2008/expert-review?ncid=aolaut00050000000017", "confidence": 0.5, "details": null}]}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

Now you get to fix it.\n\nYou declared you run all mail handling as an unprivileged user. Then you try\nto run sa-learn as root on root's mailbox. There is rather a problem there \nif\nyou think about it. Sit and ruminate a few minutes. Seriously - think.\n\nHave you considered what you are doing and where at least one\nhyper-obvious problem lies?\n\nIf you're not banging your forehead and screaming \"Doh!\" by now here is the\nclue bat. If you've figured it out, \"DUCK!\"\n\nSpamAssassin will be using a Bayes database collected as that unprivileged\nuser. It cannot use one generated as root and placed in root's directory\nstructure. The last I knew you were trying to use per user Bayes. So\nsa-learn as root will build the file in a place the unprivileged process\ncannot access AND will likely leave the file with privileges that prevent\naccess by that unprivileged user.\n\nThat's issue one for you to fix.\n\nAnd if you don't fix your errant ways mama's gonna whup you good.\n\nWhat size machine are you trying to work on? How deep into your swap\nfile are you when you run sa-learn?\n\n{^_^}   Joanne, ashamed I've known you all these years, Gene. You shame\n        me by not taking advice repeated virtually every time we\n        communicate.\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: No URLs identified\n    additional_emails: []\n\n    sender_name: jdow\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 16:14:00 -0800\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 100, "explanation": "Legitimate email with no suspicious content or links.", "recommendation": "No action required.", "urls": [], "url_check_results": []}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

All I know is what I heard, and read (and quoted above) about the \nHome edition of XP.\n\nOf course, it is in XP Professional that most people who use it at home \nwho never get past the first account - the Administrator - and do not \ncreate a user with limited access rights.\n\nThe need to create a normal, limited access, user in XP Professional is \nnot something which is enforced in Professional which is why, I \nunderstand, most XP Prof. setups are being run by a home user with full \nAdmin. rights.

Fresh installs of 10.3. \n\nWe could see an access point but could not connect the majority of the\ntime. When we were able to connect, signal strength in the Gnome Network\nManager applet would be in the low teens, speed would never be above 24\nMbs and overall performance would be extremely poor. \n\nAfter much troubleshoot I discovered that during installation both the\nipw3945 and the iwl3945 kernel modules got installed. Yast chose the\nipw3945 module when setting up the wireless.  From some of the messages\nI've seen when Googleing Intel 3945, there seem to be some significant\nissues with the ipw3945 kernel driver.  \n\nThe fix is to in YAST, select Configure on the Wireless Card. Select the\nHardware Tab, then change the Kernel Module in the Module Name Drop down\nlist from the ipw3945 to the iwl3945.  Save the settings and exit out of\nYAST.  Reboot the laptop.  \n\nIf the iwl3945 kernel module is not in the list install it first then\nreboot and change.\n\nAccording to the chatter, some of the features of the iwl3945 module are\ndone yet. Like illuminating the blue Wifi light and displaying the\nconnection speed in the Network manager. But other than those cosmetic\nissues, it is reliable and works every time I boot.

This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.\n\n2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py\n\n3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.\n\nThis is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>Comment By: SourceForge Robot (sf-robot)\nDate: 2007-05-25 19:20\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=1312539\nOriginator: NO\n\nThis Tracker item was closed automatically by the system.

A couple comments:\n\n* The \"--cullext\" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have\n\"--cull\" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. \nLet me know if you have a different change in mind.\n\n* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.

This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.\n\n2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py\n\n3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.\n\nThis is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>Comment By: David Abrahams (david_abrahams)\nDate: 2007-05-26 01:05\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=52572\nOriginator: YES\n\nOn --cullext vs --cull, I was thinking it could be '--cullext=' but if\ngetopt doesn't like that, I'm fine with --cull.\n\nSince tony isn't very active, the thing got auto-closed.

A couple comments:\n\n* The \"--cullext\" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have\n\"--cull\" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. \nLet me know if you have a different change in mind.\n\n* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in\ncase he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.

It is to force \nvmsify to treat the input specification as UNIX.\n\nThere is a VMS::Filespec::unixpath() to do the appending of the '/' to \nthe specification, which will do a VMS::Filespec::vmsify() if needed.\n\nHowever it is not a good idea to call vmsify() on a pathname returned by \nunixify(), and it is not a good idea to call unixify() on a pathname \nreturned by vmsify().  Because of the nature of the conversion, not all \nfile specifications can make the round trip.\n\nI think that directory specifications can safely make the round trip, \nbut not ones containing filenames.\n\n-John\nho0ebg@qsl.net\nPersonal Opinion Only\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: No URLs identified\n    additional_emails: ['ho0ebg@qsl.net']\n\n    sender_name: \"John E.

Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.\n\nThis is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n>Comment By: Skip Montanaro (montanaro)\nDate: 2007-05-26 09:21\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=44345\nOriginator: NO\n\nI've already applied the patch.

The code reads:\n\n         elif opt in (\"-c\", \"--cullext\"):\n             cullext = arg\n         elif opt in (\"-C\", \"--cullext\"):\n             cullext = ''\nIn general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. \nThanks for that...  A couple comments:\n\n* The \"--cullext\" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have\n\"--cull\" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. \nLet me know if you have a different change in mind.\n\n* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in\ncase he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it\nclosed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take\nissue with.\n\n* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)\n\nSkip\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment By: David Abrahams (david_abrahams)\nDate: 2007-05-10 20:18\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=52572\nOriginator: YES\n\nGreat!

I'm slowly working on moving suspend2.net/tuxonice.net to a new server based on Slicehost. (We've been abusing the kindness of the UWA computer club for too long). I've completed moving the wiki to the new server earlier in the afternoon - all going well, you shouldn't notice a difference yet. I'm looking to make some changes, though, to reduce issues with spam. At the moment I have some lines commented out that will limit editing so that a secure http connection is required. The other possibility is using captcha. I wouldn't mind any feedback people would like to give. In an hour or two, I plan on shifting email to the new server. This means that lists in particular will be down for at least part of the evening (Australian Eastern Standard Time). In the process, I'm going to rename the suspend2-* lists to tuxonice-*.

[Patch] Test patch for those with I/O speed issues.

To: TuxOnIce-users  Message-ID: <47AD8023.5010905@nigel.suspend2.net> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=\"iso-8859-1\" Hi all. Here are test patches which should be of interest to this who've been having problems with the I/O speed. I'm providing patches for 2.6.23.15 and 2.6.24.1. The whole lowlevel I/O code has had quite a rework. In /sys/power/tuxonice/block_io, the only remaining entry is target_outstanding_io, which can be used to say how much memory you'd like to have made available for I/O. If more is available, it will be used too. There's one new entry in the /sys/power/tuxonice directory - no_flusher_thread. This entry is only useful if you've got multiple cpus/cores, and then only if no_multithreaded_io is 0 (ie multithreaded I/O is enabled). What I've done is this: by default, we now dedicate one thread (the CPU 0 one) to just submitting I/O. All other threads spend their time compressing pages and filling pages with the compressed data and associated metadata, then queueing filled pages for the submission thread to handle. If there's only one thread or no_flusher_thread is used, we go back to the old behaviour - threads compress, fill pages and submit them. So... options for multicore users: 1) Single threaded operation procsetting no_multithreaded_io 1 2) Multithreaded, flusher thread (default) procsetting no_multithreaded_io 0 procsetting no_flusher_thread 0 3) Multithreaded, no flusher thread procsetting no_multithreaded_io 0 procsetting no_flusher_thread 1 If you give the patches a try, would you please let me know how these different options perform?

I had to change it because in its original form it was corrupting   the header when I pasted it into this message.   I think its not anything malicious and that its bitten mail sent by Mr. Franklin because of something unique in the headers when his response reached the SA listserver. I think it may have something to do with the SA mailing list software. Reasons: - In the past I've noticed that mail I've sent has appeared on the   mailing list minus the first line of the body. When I looked at   what I sent the first line was present and correct - If I pick off the mailbox part of all addresses after the 0x81   byte I get:   \"Can you point me to a good regex tutorial? The one I have    found has\",   which is the first line of Mr. Franklin's message. In the   message I received the body of this message starts from his   second line:    \"given me a lot of good starting stuff, but it doesn't mention   the ?:,\" Has anybody else seen this problem? I'd really like this to be fixed as its littering my mail archiving system with junk addresses. I'm unable to include the message as received - sorry. I've tried, but its content is causing Evolution to corrupt the outgoing headers.

The Special Track on Uncertain Reasoning at the\nEighteenth International Florida Artificial Intelligence Research\nSymposium (FLAIRS) Conference seeks to bring together researchers\nworking on broad issues related to reasoning under uncertainty. This\ntrack was started in 1996 and has become an annual event at FLAIRS. In\n2003 the track was merged with the Special Track on Imprecise and\nIndeterminate Probabilities.\n\nPapers on all aspects of uncertain reasoning and imprecise\nprobabilities are solicited.  Topics of interest include, but are not\nlimited to:\n\n* Uncertain reasoning and databases \n* Uncertain reasoning formalisms, calculi and methodologies \n* Reasoning with probability, possibility, fuzzy logic, belief functions, \n  argumentation, rough sets, and probability logics \n* Modelling and reasoning using imprecise and indeterminate information, \n* using for instance: Choquet capacities, comparative orderings, convex \nsets of measures, \n  and interval-valued probabilities \n* Exact, approximate and qualitative uncertain reasoning \n* Nonmonotonic reasoning and belief revision \n* Multi-agent uncertain reasoning and decision making \n* Decision-theoretic planning and Markov decision process \n* Temporal reasoning and uncertainty \n* Construction of models from elicitation, data mining and knowledge \ndiscovery \n* Uncertain reasoning in information retrieval, filtering, fusion, \ndiagnosis, \n  prediction, and situation assessment \n* Practical applications of uncertain reasoning \n\n\nPaper Submission and Publication\n---------------------------------\nPaper format and submission details are available at \nhttp://earth.cs.ccsu.edu/~flairs/submission.html\n\nPapers will be refereed and all accepted papers will appear in the \nconference proceedings which will be published by AAAI Press. \nSelected authors will be invited to submit extended versions of their \npapers to a special issue of the International Journal on Artificial \nIntelligence Tools (IJAIT) to be published in 2006. \n\nIn addition, we will be arranging a special issue of the International \nJournal of\nApproximate Reasoning, devoted to extended and revised papers selected \nfrom the special \ntrack on uncertain reasoning.\n\n\nInvited Speakers of FLAIRS-2005\n--------------------------------\nLawrence Hunter, University of Colorado \nMartha Pollack, University of Michigan\nTed Senator, DARPA \nDavid Stork, Ricoh and Stanford University\n\n\nImportant Dates\n----------------\nPaper submissions due       October 22, 2004\nNotification letters sent   January 7, 2005\nCamera ready copy due       February 4, 2005\nConference:                 May 16-18, 2005\n\n\nProgram Committee\n---------------------\nProgram Co-Chairs:\nGabriele Kern-Isberner, University of Dortmund\nDan Wu, University of Windsor\n\nCommittee:\nHoracio Arlo-Costa, Carnegie Mellon University\nSalem Benferhat, CRIL, France\nCory Butz, University of Regina\nMats Danielson, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden\nJim Delgrande, Simon Fraser University\nMarek Druzdzel, University of Pittsburgh\nLove Ekenberg, Stockholm University\nFaiza Khellaf, USTHB, Algeria\nHenry Kyburg, IHMC and The University of Rochester\nEric Neufeld, University of Saskatchewan\nLaurent Perrussel, UT1/IRIT, France\nLin Tao, University of Regina\nEugene Santos, University of Connecticut\nChoh Man Teng, University of West Florida\nMichael Wong, University of Regina\nYang Xiang, University of Guelph\n\n\nContact\n-------\nFor Further Information, please contact:\n\nGabriele Kern-Isberner\nDepartment of Computer Science\nUniversity of Dortmund \n44221 Dortmund, Germany\ncbzllrja.iadf-sizpcbzl@cs.uni-dortmund.de\n\nDan Wu \nSchool of Computer Science\nUniversity of Windsor\nWindsor Ontario Canada N9B 3P4 \nedaxa@uwindsor.ca\n\n\n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: ['http://janus.newcs.uwindsor.ca/']\n    additional_emails: ['edaxa@uwindsor.ca', 'cbzllrja.iadf-sizpcbzl@cs.uni-dortmund.de']\n\n    sender_name: edax\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 16:13:32 -0700\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 0, "explanation": "Legitimate conference email with some minor red flags.", "recommendation": "Proceed with caution but consider attending the conference.", "urls": ["http://janus.newcs.uwindsor.ca/"], "url_check_results": [{"is_malicious": false, "url": "http://janus.newcs.uwindsor.ca/", "confidence": 0.5, "details": "Not blacklisted"}]}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

Can it wait till \nI've had a chance to hit my thumbs with another cortisone shot?  On second \nthought, the iron bar is less painful in the short term.  The last time I \nchecked, they wanted to do surgery at $5k per thumb and I said how about \ncortisone?  He said then (15 years ago) that it was $60 a shot, and it would \nhurt like hell.  He was right on both counts, but that thumb still works \ntoday.  Now its the other ones turn I guess.  :)\n\n-- \nCheers, Gene\n\"There are four boxes to be used in defense of liberty:\n soap, ballot, jury, and ammo.

The first account has admin\nrights and many people don't go beyond that to create users with\nrestricted rights.  They simply don't realize the difference between\nadmin and user.  At least in Linux, at least SUSE, you get warnings\nabout running as root and you're expected to create a user during\ninstall.  With Ubuntu and some other distros, the first user is an admin\nuser, with rights to create a root password.  Additional users are mere\nmortals.\n\n\n\n\n-- \nUse OpenOffice.org \n\n    -------\n    URLs Identified in Body: No URLs identified\n    additional_emails: []\n\n    sender_name: James Knott\n\n    date_received: Tue, 05 Aug 2008 19:22:14 -0500\n\n  ", "output": {"is_phishing": false, "trust_score": 20, "explanation": "Some red flags present, but no conclusive evidence of phishing.", "recommendation": "Be cautious when responding to this email or clicking on any links.", "urls": [], "url_check_results": []}, "llm_model": "llama3.2:3b", "evaluation": {"actual_label": false, "predicted_label": false, "is_correct": true}}

My previous experience with virtualization\nsoftware has been frustrating, to say the list.

I'm happy I'm wrong there, then.\n>\n> Good luck with it, please let us know how it goes.\n\nHere I go. I'm writing this notes as I go, but I'll post when I finish.\n\n\n1) It is designed for an older set of libraries.\n\nGtk-WARNING **: Failed to load module \"libgnomebreakpad.so\": libgnomebreakpad.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nBut it does exist, in \"/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/modules/libgnomebreakpad.so\". I \nguess it is looking for an older version.\n\n\n2) It does not support UTF8\n\nIt displays latin1, and when I type an accented letter it displays two \nstrange letters - so no utf. I had to start an xterm in latin1:\n\n   LANG=en_US.ISO-8859-1 LC_ALL=en_US.ISO-8859-1 /usr/bin/xterm -bd blue &\n\nand from there I fire up manedit.\n\nThis could be the worst problem of all, because there is no way to edit in \nutf8 with manedit. Do you know if current man pages are supposed to be UTF \nor latin1?\n\n[see later]\n\n3) It is an XML editor, which it translates to troff when saving; and it \nis not WYSIWYG - but that is what you said in your write up. I'd like it \nto have a toggle to show the formatted output, but no.\n\n\n4) It warns that if I enable syntax highlighting, it may crash. So far it \nhasn't, but who knows...\n\n5) I can not even change the font size: the letters get substituted by \nsquares, or I loose accents. I had to delete the configuration file to \nrestore working defaults. It must be a byproduct of not supporting utf.\n\n\n[...]\n\nI haven't finished yet, but I found a blocker.\n\nThe program does it job fairly well, but the locale encoding turns out to \nbe a problem.\n\nI asked the people of the project for whom I'm translating their \npages, whether they wanted the pages in latin1 or utf8, and the answer is \n\"neither\":\n\n]  Characters outside the ASCII printable range must be encoded; see\n]  groff_char(7) (but note that we use \"\\\\('e\" rather than \"\\\\['e]\").\n\n\nThis is a problem too with manual pages in the suse distro: they either \ndisplay well in latin 1 or in utf 8, but not both. And using the encoding \ndescribed in groff_char(7) they display correctly in both. The blocker is \nthat manedit does not support that encoding.\n\nI would have to write \"ol\\\\('e\" instead of \"ol\u00e9\", which may be just \na nuisance for a coder, but it is a big inconvenience for a writer: I can \nnot spell check the file, and my sight doesn't see \"ol\u00e9\" but gibberish, so \nI can't proofread the text.\n\n:-/\n\nI don't understand how nobody has created a good program for writing \ndocumentation \"man\" files by mere mortals, not by coders. And I do \nunderstand now why some projects refuse altogether to create a man page \nand make do instead with html or pdf files, or why man page translations \nare so obsolete as to be useless, when they do exist.\n\n\nI have also discarded (and some tried) gmanedit, gconglomerate, gjots2, \npandoc, zoem...\n\nI don't know what I will do. :-/\n\n\n\n- -- \nCheers,\n        Carlos E.

Not sure what the problem is, \nbut the NX feature would be nice to turn on.  Does \nanyone know if NX can be disabled at the application \nlevel so that the other processes were protected with \nNX?\n\nMark\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment By: Zian (zianchoy)\nDate: 2007-06-04 03:35\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=1059620\nOriginator: NO\n\nThe DEP /NX issue is not restricted to Athlon chips. I am using an Intel\nCore 2 Duo processor. When DEP is enabled via software in the System dialog\nin Windows XP MCE (probably also applies to Windows Vista), Outlook fails\nto load the plugin.\n\nThe web page text needs to remove the processor limitation.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment By: Jimmy Retzlaff (jretz)\nDate: 2006-12-07 23:10\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=101588\nOriginator: NO\n\nI've tried a few basic Python programs packaged with py2exe 0.6.5 and\nPython 2.4 with hardware DEP enabled on Windows XP SP2 on a newer Pentium-M\n(with XD support) and on Windows Server 2003 on an Athlon 64 (with NX\nsupport). Everything seems to work fine. I tried all of py2exe's bundle\noptions and couldn't get Windows to complain. The Python scripts I used for\ntesting only do simple arithmetic and make use of EasyDialogs for Windows\n(which uses ctypes).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment By: Tony Meyer (anadelonbrin)\nDate: 2006-02-05 00:20\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=552329\n\nDoes that mean you predict that any py2exe program would\nfail to run?

It isn't\nobvious to me that is *is* the problem, but it certainly is\npossible.  It would be interesting to know if the source\nversion of SpamBayes has the same problem.  When I get back\nto Aus, I will try and reproduce this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment By: Paul Quinn (paulquinn)\nDate: 2004-07-20 08:04\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=815032\n\nThis is a problem with NX protection...this is how I got it to \nwork:\n\nThere are ways to disable NX at application level:\na) Through the UI...\ni) \"Control Panel\" > \"System\"\nii) Click on the \"Advanced\" tab\niii) Under \"Performance\" section, click \"Settings\"\niv) Click on the \"Data Execution Prevention\" tab\nv) Click \"Add\" and select the appication you want to disable \nNX for\n\nb) Registry...\nUnder \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows \nNT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\AppCompatFlags\\\\Layers\" (there are \nequivalent HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys), create a new string \nkey, its name being the full path to the executable file you \nwant to disable NX for, the value being \"DisableNXShowUI\"\n\n.you'll notice that in the UI, only executable files can be \nadded. This means that I had to select the \"Outlook.exe\" file \nto get Spambayes to work again. I tried adding the \nspambayes_addin.dll and the python23.dll paths to the registry \nas a workaround, but this didn't work...\n\nAlso, if you are using Outlook 2003, you may need to re-enable \nthe plug-in by deleting its resilliency key (the COM Add-in \nManager won't remember the re-enable setting no matter how \nmany times you try):\nhttp://groups.google.co.uk/groups?\nhl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&safe=off&selm=uZ%24FJzyFEHA.3984%\n40TK2MSFTNGP10.phx.gbl\n\nFYI, the same techniques work with Inboxer etc. I'm guessing, \nas tim_one said, it's to do with the Python libraries.\n\nPaul \n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nComment By: Tim Peters (tim_one)\nDate: 2004-07-09 10:35\n\nMessage:\nLogged In: YES \nuser_id=31435\n\nYou'll really have to ask about NX gimmicks on an Athlon list.\n\nSpamBayes is written entirely in the Python programming \nlanguage, and that never, ever tries to execute code from a \ndata region (I'm very familiar with Python's implementation)   \nMy only guess is that Outlook itself, or MAPI, try to do this \nwhen interfacing with extensions.
